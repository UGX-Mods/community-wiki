<p>This error is directly related to how many unique strings you've used in scripts, un-#include'ing files does not add to this error, removing lines of script does not remove this error, removing script lines which contain strings <strong>does</strong> remove this error.</p>
<p>bucket usage seems to be dynamic, buckets become free with time.</p>
<p>Recommended solution: reduce the amount of unique strings used in your custom scripts or remove unused Treyarch SP scripts from being loaded during compile.</p>
<h2>How to check current string memory usage</h2>
<p>Console command: "stringUsage"</p>
<p>&gt; Check console for substree bucket output.</p>
