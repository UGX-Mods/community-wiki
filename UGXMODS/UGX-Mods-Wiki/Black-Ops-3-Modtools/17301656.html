                    <p>Zones in BO3 pretty much work the same way they did in World at War, so this page will only cover the changes in BO3. For a full guide to zones, refer to <a href="Ultimate-Guide-to-Zones-in-v1.4-Maps_1146967.html">Ultimate Guide to Zones in v1.4 Maps</a>.</p><p> </p><h2 id="BO3|AddingZones-CreatingZones">Creating Zones</h2><p>Drag a info\volume from the entity browser into your map and give the volume the zone KVPs you learned from the WaW guide.</p><h2 id="BO3|AddingZones-KVPChanges">KVP Changes</h2><p>Zones now also act as playable area for players. If you want a zone to denote an area that the player is allowed to be, add the following KVP to it:</p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="wrapped confluenceTable"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner"><p>Key</p></div></th><th class="confluenceTh"><div class="tablesorter-header-inner"><p>Value</p></div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>script_noteworthy</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>player_volume</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p>You'll notice that if you don't have any player volumes in your map, you'll die as soon as you spawn into your map.</p>
