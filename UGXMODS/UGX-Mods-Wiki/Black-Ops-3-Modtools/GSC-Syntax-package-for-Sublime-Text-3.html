                    <p>Thanks to the Treyarch PC development team we now have our own GSC syntax for Sublime Text 3! Another thing is that it is fairly easy to install.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>Make sure that you installed the BO3 modtools and that they are up-to-date! This ensures that you are installing the latest version!</strong></p></div></div><p></p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-tip"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-approve confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Before reading this guide, determine where your Black Ops 3 root directory is located.</p><p><strong> Non-Steam Install</strong>: C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty Black Ops III\</p><p><strong>Steam Install</strong>: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\<span>Call of Duty Black Ops III</span>\</p><p>For the rest of this guide, it will be assumed that the word &quot;root&quot; refers to the appropriate installation path shown above.</p><p>Say 'Yes to all' if Windows asks you about replacing files when dragging files into your root directory.</p></div></div><h2 id="BO3|GSCSyntaxpackageforSublimeText3-Features">Features</h2><p>The GSC package contains some useful tools to make BO3 scripting easier and more convenient. </p><p>Some of these functions are:</p><ul><li>Auto-complete</li><li>Syntax highlighting</li><li>Function suggestions</li></ul><h2 id="BO3|GSCSyntaxpackageforSublimeText3-Installingthepackage">Installing the package</h2><p>This package is located in <strong>root/docs_modtools.</strong></p><p>Here you will find a zip-file named &quot;gsc_sublime.zip&quot;. Once located you will want to extract the files contents into a folder called GSC / What ever you want. This part is not that important but the contents of that &quot;.zip&quot; must go into a folder. Now copy that folder you have created ( the folder &amp; its contents are now saved into your clipboard ).</p><p>Next navigate to your Sublime Text 3 root directory. This can be done easily by launching Sublime Text 3, going to &quot;<em>Preferences</em>&quot; (Top bar) and clicking on &quot;<em>Browse Packages</em>&quot;. Your packages folder will now open. Paste your folder in there. You're done! </p><p>Now you can restart Sublime Text (if it was still open) and in the bottom right you should be able to select GSC from the list!</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="http://i.imgur.com/kiXVHuB.png" data-image-src="http://i.imgur.com/kiXVHuB.png"></span></p><p> </p><p>Credits: <a class="external-link" href="http://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=364024" rel="nofollow">Tustin</a>(Creator) &amp; <a class="external-link" href="http://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=16378" rel="nofollow">Lukkie1998</a>(Doc converter)</p>
