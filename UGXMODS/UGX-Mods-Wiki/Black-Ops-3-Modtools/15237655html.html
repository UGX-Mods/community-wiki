                    <h2 id="BO3|Addingcustommaterialsandtextures-ImageFormat">Image Format</h2><p>Images were previously able to be in DDS, TGA, and JPG formats on previous Call of Duty titles; however, Black Ops 3 only supports one image format: TIFF.</p><p>Photoshop and Gimp both have this format included in their base products, and don't require plugins to export to this format.</p><p> </p><p>Images are now setup as an actual file in APE (Asset Property Editor). This means when you create a material file, you will also have to create multiple image files containing the directory</p><p>to the images those image files represent. This can be easily done through the material though, as it will contain an image button that will auto name and create the file for you.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" draggable="false" src="attachments/15237655/15237740.png" data-image-src="attachments/15237655/15237740.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15237740" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="20cbf9d432868b4ca182a2f953878b5b.png" data-base-url="https://confluence.ugx-mods.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15237655" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" alt=""></span></p><h2 id="BO3|Addingcustommaterialsandtextures-ImageTypes">Image Types</h2><div class="table-wrap"><table class="wrapped confluenceTable"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh">Image Type</th><th class="confluenceTh">Description</th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Diffuse Color</p><p>(Albedo Map)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This map contains all the color data for the image as well as an Alpha channel if required for blend textures and alpha textures.</p><p>This does not include any lighting information for the material.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Normal</td><td class="confluenceTd">This map applys detail to the image allowing certain errors to react to light to simulate holes, cracks, grooves and other deformities of the material.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">Detail Normal</td><td class="confluenceTd">Usually used to give finer details on the material such as small scratches and other geometry details.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Occlusion</p><p>(Ambient Occlusion)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This texture is used only in specific cases where the user wants to show the shadows of deformities to the material more clearly.</p><p>It will affect the amount of ambient light and amount of reflection probe will be visible on the surface.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Specular</p><p>(Metallic)</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This map will determine which areas of the material are metallic and which are non-metallic.</p><p>Non-metal areas are represented by black and metal ares are represented by white.

This is similar to the</p><p>environment map from previous Call of Duty titles, but is categorized by materials.
