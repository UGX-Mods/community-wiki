                    <p>Page is a work in progress</p><ul><li>Reflection Probes count as 1 image each</li><li>Removing iwi's from your IWD does absolutely nothing towards lowering the image asset count for the engine error. The 2400 count is images included by fastfile-loaded assets only. IWI images are not loaded into engine memory which is why they don't count.</li><li>Duplicate includes of the same image count as only a single slot total used.</li><li>The &quot;real&quot; limit is somewhere around 2358 images due to images embedded in fastfiles and engine assets which cannot be removed.</li></ul>
