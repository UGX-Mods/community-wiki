<p>
  We try our best to keep up with industry standards and ensure that we always
  improve our security.
</p>
<p>Our ongoing effort is to harden our systems and improve our services.</p>
<h2 id="Security-VulnerabilityDisclosure">Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
<p>We always are eager to improve and if you found something, let us know!</p>
<p>
  We are thankful for any information about a possible vulnerabilities in our
  systems, products or services.
</p>
<p>
  If you believe you found something, don't hesitate and contact us at 
  <a class="external-link" href="mailto:security@ugx-mods.com" rel="nofollow">
    security@ugx-mods.com
  </a>
   and get in touch with us.
</p>
<p>
  In order to verify it we appreciate if we get information like a proof of
  concept, tools used and whatever information might be useful for this report.
</p>
<p>
  Once verified and depending on the scale we will notify users and keep updates
  about the issue as they arrive.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Unfortunately we can't give a bounty reward in cash, but publicity (if you
  want) and other UGX-Mods benefits might be rewarding to you as well.
</p>
<h2 id="Security-GDPRComplience">GDPR Complience</h2>
<p>
  Since May 25th 2018 the new
  <a
    class="external-link"
    href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en"
    rel="nofollow">
     General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  </a>
   is effective.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  UGX-Mods tries it's best to comply with it and inform consumers about their
  rights.
</p>
<p>
  In our customer favor, every consumer regardless of his residency will be
  treated equally and receive the same improvements and tools to enhance their
  privacy and consumer rights.
</p>
<p>
  As a tiny team which is based on volunteer work it's impossible to upkeep and
  maintain the same standards as bigger companies.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless UGX-Mods is dedicated and optimistic to ensure a secure system
  and mechanism to protect and secure consumers rights and data.
</p>
<h2 id="Security-DataSecurityandPrivacy">Data Security and Privacy</h2>
<h3 id="Security-DataSecurity">Data Security</h3>
<p>
  We use SSL/TLS (https://) only on our products and services. (some legacy
  products might still use https but will be deprecated by the end of 2018!)
</p>
<p>
  You can view our latest SSL Labs Report here:

  </a>
   (A+ is the highest possible grade)
</p>
<h3 id="Security-DataRetention">Data Retention</h3>
<p>Most of the user data is kept until the account will be deleted.</p>
<p>
  We store certain log data longer (like bans, security alerts) for
  investigation and fraud detection.
</p>
<p>
  Other log data (like application errors) will be truncated after 90 days or
  sooner.
</p>
<h3 id="Security-DataRemoval">Data Removal</h3>
<p>
  All customer data stored is eradicated upon a customer’s termination of
  service and deletion of account after an manual investigation to prevent
  accidental cancellation / fraud.
</p>
<p>
  Data can also be usually deleted in for each product &amp; service in the
  settings.
</p>
<h2 id="Security-ApplicationSecurity">Application Security</h2>
<p>
  We always make sure to use the latest stable version of external dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  Common practices are used to ensure that accounts can't be easily hijacked.
</p>
<p>
  We plan to integrate 2FA (two factor authentication) and notifcations about
  authentications from a new IP. Due to limited resources an estimate is not
  possible.
</p>
<h3 id="Security-EmailSecurity">Email Security</h3>
<p>
  We send out emails with our own mail server and via SparkPost (
  <a
    class="external-link"
    href="https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/security/"
    rel="nofollow">
    https://www.sparkpost.com/policies/security/
  </a>
  ).
</p>
<p>
  We use 
  <span style="color: rgb(22, 17, 28)">
    Sender policy framework (SPF),
    <span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34)">DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM</span>
    <span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34)">) </span>
    <span style="color: rgb(22, 17, 28)">
      and domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance
      (DMARC) set up for monitoring reports to prevent the possibility of
      phishing scams.
    </span>
  </span>

<h2 id="Security-Infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<h4 id="Security-PhysicalAccessControl">Physical Access Control</h4>
<p>
  Our servers are located in OVH data centers. More information is available
  here:

    https://www.ovh.com/world/about-us/security.xml
  </a>
</p>
<h4 id="Security-LogicalAccessControl">Logical Access Control</h4>
<p>
  Access to our servers is kept to a minimum of administrators with private key
  over an encrypted connection.
</p>
<h4 id="Security-IntrustionDetectionandPrevention">
  Intrustion Detection and Prevention
</h4>
<p>At the moment we only have basic systems in place to block bruteforce.</p>
<p>We plan for 2018 to implement properly IDS services on all our servers.</p>
<h4 id="Security-PenetrationTesting">Penetration Testing</h4>
<p>
  Due to our small team we are not able to do or get any penetration testing at
  the moment done. If UGX-Mods grows we are eager to improve here.
</p>
<h3 id="Security-Audits">Audits</h3>
<p>
  We do a security audit at least once a year with various tools to ensure that
  our systems are following best practice.
</p>
<p>
  3rd party external audits are due to the small team size and scope not
  possible at the moment.
</p>
<h3 id="Security-Backups">Backups</h3>
<p>
  We create weekly full backups and each day incremental backups. Those will be
  encrypted based on industry standards and mirrored to other dedicated servers
  under our control.
</p>
<h3 id="Security-Documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>
  We have an internal wiki about security and best practice to ensure members of
  UGX-Mods are up-2-date with security information and workflows.
