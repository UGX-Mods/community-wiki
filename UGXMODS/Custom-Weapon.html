<p>
  This is a comprehensive (and long overdue) tutorial on adding custom, animated
  weapons to CoD. The only two prerequisites to this tutorial are that you have
  Maya 8.5 with IW's xAnim/xModel Export Plugin or Maya 2012-2014 with
  <a href="Maya-2012-2014-Xmodel-and-Xanim-Export-Tool_1146918.html"
    >Aidan's xAnim/xModel Export Plugin</a
  >
  as well as an already completed weapon mesh to work with.
</p>

<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Importing">Importing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    First, open your completed weapon mesh into maya. To ensure that your weapon
    is interpreted correctly by the engine, make sure your model has correct
    topology before continuing(details can be found about this via google).
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Rotate your weapon so the muzzle is pointing in the X+ direction and the top
    of the weapon is pointing in the Z+ direction. Now with your weapon mesh
    selected go to &quot;Modify&gt;Freeze Transformations&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    (OPTIONAL) Import a weapon created by IW or Treyarch into your scene to
    compare scale. Once your weapon scale is matched proportionally to the
    example weapon you can delete the example from the scene. If you are having
    trouble obtaining an example weapon, one can be found at
    &quot;root/bin/maya/model_src/modern_weapons/m16/weapon_m16.mb&quot; within
    the COD4 mod tools.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure the polygon menu set is selected and select all your weapon
    meshes. Now click the &quot;Color&quot; menu button and hit the square
    outline beside the &quot;Apply Color&quot; button. A dialog box should
    appear. Under the &quot;Color Value&quot; section ensure the
    &quot;Color&quot; slider is positioned all the way to the right, resulting
    in the color preview being blank white. With your meshes still selected hit
    &quot;Apply Color&quot; on the dialog box and within shaded mode you will
    see all your meshes become blank white. This is required for your textures
    to appear within game, otherwise they would appear pitch black.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open the hypershade by going to &quot;Window&gt;Rendering
    Editors&gt;Hypershade&quot;. Once open select the &quot;materials&quot; tab.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ensure that all surfaces have a material applied to them and no surfaces
    have the initial shading group applied.
  </li>
  <li>
    The material names here will match the names of the materials we will be
    creating in asset manager. Make sure that all materials have appropriate
    names. For example, if I had a material that colored the main piece of the
    weapon, I would call it &quot;mtl_*WEAPONNAME<em
      >main&quot;. Or if I had a material that was applied to a scope on the
      weapon I would call it &quot;mtl</em
    >WEAPONNAME_scope&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Rigging">Rigging</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    (OPTIONAL) Switch to the side orthographic viewport for easier joint
    placement.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Select the animation shelf above the main viewport and click the
    &quot;Joint&quot; tool. You can now click anywhere in the viewport to place
    a joint. Place a new joint in the lower receiver of the weapon just above
    the grip. Open the outliner by going to &quot;Window&gt;Outliner&quot; and
    rename the joint you just created to &quot;J_Gun&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Repeat the last step except you will now want to name your joint
    &quot;tag_clip&quot;. Once your second joint has been named middle mouse
    click and drag the second joint onto the &quot;J_Gun&quot; joint. This will
    make &quot;J_Gun&quot; a parent of &quot;tag_clip&quot;. With the tag clip
    joint selected use the &quot;Move&quot; tool to move the joint into the
    center of your clip mesh.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will now want to create 3 duplicates of &quot;tag_clip&quot; as well as
    one for each attachment you have on the weapon by selecting
    &quot;tag_clip&quot; and pressing Ctrl + D. Name the new joints
    &quot;tag_flash&quot;, &quot;tag_brass&quot; and &quot;j_bolt&quot;. Any
    attachment joints you create should have the naming convention of
    &quot;tag_*ATTACHMENT&quot;. Ex: &quot;tag_holographic&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    &quot;tag_flash&quot; is where the muzzle flash FX will spawn in game. Place
    it at the end of the barrel half way into the muzzle. &quot;tag_brass&quot;
    is where the shell ejection FX will spawn in game. Place this joint flush
    with the ejection port on the weapon. &quot;j_bolt&quot; is the joint that
    will control movement of the bolt on the weapon. Place this joint inside the
    bolt handle for easy selection. If the weapon you are animating is a pistol
    &quot;j_bolt&quot; will control the pistol's slide.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    First select &quot;tag_clip&quot;, then your clip mesh. With the
    &quot;Animation&quot; menu set selected go to &quot;Skin&gt;Bind
    Skin&gt;Smooth Bind&quot;. With your joint selected and wireframe mode on
    the clip mesh will now appear pink. This means that the selected joint is
    bound to the highlighted mesh.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Select &quot;j_bolt&quot;, then the bolt mesh and repeat the above step.
    Once j_bolt is bound to the bolt mesh select &quot;J_Gun&quot; and then
    select any meshes which aren't already bound to one of the previous joints.
    Now once again repeat the step above. With &quot;J_Gun&quot; selected in
    wireframe mode all meshes should now appear pink.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Select &quot;J_Gun&quot;, then go to &quot;Edit&gt;Select Hierarchy&quot;.
    Now go to &quot;Create&gt;Sets&gt;Set&quot;. In the outliner you will see a
    newly created set, likely called &quot;set1&quot;. Inside will be your
    weapon's joints. Rename the set to &quot;GunExport&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Exporting">Exporting</h3>
<h1 id="CustomWeapon-Animation">Animation</h1>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Preparation">Preparation</h3>
<p>
  Open /bin/maya/model_src/modern_weapons/m16/weapon_m16.mb with Maya.<br />
  Open Outliner and expand the J_Gun tree. Hold Shift and select m16_high, then
  select the last join in the J_Gun tree. Go to Modify -&gt; Freeze
  Transformations, then Edit -&gt; Delete All by Type -&gt; History. Now, in the
  top left corner of Maya on the tool bar, click the dropdown box and select
  Animation. Now select Skin -&gt; Detach. Now select and delete all 3 m16 poly
  groups.
</p>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Importing.1">Importing</h3>
<p>
  Go to File -&gt; Import and find your gun. It will be imported into the scene.
  Now you must bind the joints to the skin.
</p>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Binding">Binding</h3>
<p>
  In order for the viewhands to know what to grab, and for the game to know what
  part of the mesh to move, you must bind joins to their corresponding meshes.
</p>
<p>To this you must first</p>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Save+Export">Save + Export</h3>
<p>
  You have now finished the rig for this weapon. Save the scene in /Call of Duty
  World at War/model_export/ as weapon_gunname.mb. Go to the CoDWaW Plugin Menu
  and choose Model Exporter. If you don't see an Entry, click add new entry.
  Otherwise, continue.
</p>
<p>
  Tick the box on the left next to 'Entry 1' and click the '...' next to the
  textbox. Locate weapon_gunname.mb and click OK. Now go to Window -&gt;
  Hypergraph:Hierarchy and click+drag over everything in the black window. Zoom
  in and, while holding shift, click the first 3 items (cameras) so that they
  are not selected anymore (not yellow highlighted). Then click 'Set Exports'
  and tick the 'Force export joints' box on the Model Exporter window. Now click
  'Export Selected Entities' and wait for the progress window to disappear. You
  can find the exported file in the same directory as the .mb.
</p>
<h2 id="CustomWeapon-Animating">Animating</h2>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-Viewmodel">Viewmodel</h3>
<p>
  Next you must create the viewmodel for your gun. This is the model that the
  user of the gun will see.
</p>
<p>
  Open /bin/maya/animation_src/viewmodel/m16/m16.VMGun.mb in Maya.<br />
  Now we are going to do the same thing we did for the rigging: Open Outliner
  again and expand the 'm16' and 'J_Gun' trees. Hold shift and select all items
  within these two trees and go to Skin -&gt; Detach. Now delete the 'm16' tree
  and go to File -&gt; Import. Locate your original, unrigged, unjointed model
  again and import it. Do the same thing you did before: bind the joints to mesh
  and create any new joints if necessary. Save the scene as gunname.VMGun.mb.
  Now open the Model Exporter again and go to Window -&gt; Hypergraph:Hierarchy.
  Select everything as you did before, then in the Model Export window check the
  Entry 1 box, locate your gunname.VMGun.mb, click yes to the popup window, then
  press Set Exports and tick the 'Force Export Selected Joints' box. Press
  Export Selected Entities. You will find the exported file in the same
  directory as the .mb scene.
</p>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-gunsleeve">gunsleeve</h3>
<p>
  Now that you have your weapon rig (weapon_gunname.mb), it's time to do what
  will probably be the most simple step of this tutorial: making a gunsleeve. It
  is crucial to do this step correctly or your anim will never work.
</p>
<p>
  The gunsleeve file is essentially an 'index' of all the joints and meshes
  involved in the animation. If the game cannot correctly identify all things in
  use, the anim will not play or the arms will be disfigured in-game.
</p>
<p>
  To create the gunsleeve, first open your gunname.VMGun.mb (it should still be
  open if you are following this tutorial step-by-step). Now choose CoDWaW -&gt;
  Viewmodel Tools -&gt; Create new gunsleeve Maya file. If it prompts you to
  locate Viewmodel_DefMesh.mb, you can find it in /bin/maya/rigs/viewmodel/.
  Now, save the newly created scene as gunname_gunsleeves.mb. Open Model
  Exporter and tick the Entry 1 box. Choose your gunname_gunsleeves.mb file and
  then open Window -&gt; Hypergraph:Hierarchy. Select everything and then press
  Set Exports in the Exporter window. Then Export Selected Entities. You can
  find the exported file in the same location as the .mb scene.
</p>
<h3 id="CustomWeapon-AnimatingtheModel">Animating the Model</h3>
<p>Animation process to be added here.</p>
<p>
  Save your animation scene as gunname_animation.mb. To export your anims, open
  the Animation Exporter from the CoD Menu. Open the Hypergraph and select
  everything as usual. Now in the exporter window, first 'Add new Entry' if
  there isnt one already, then tick the Entry 1 box. Now select
  gunname_animations.mb and enter the frame numbers of your animation in the
  boxes on the right. Now press 'Set Export Nodes'. It should recognize 'rig:'
  as the prefix. Now press Export Selected Entities. You will find a new file,
  .XANIM_EXPORT in the same directory. You MUST copy this file to /Call of Duty
  World at War/xanim_export/ (create this directory as it most likely does not
  exist yet). All .XMODEL_EXPORTS must be in /model_export/.
</p>
<h1 id="CustomWeapon-AssetManager">Asset Manager</h1>
<p>
  Now that you have all of your exported files, it's time to make them available
  to the game. Open Launcher, and from there click the Asset Manager button.
</p>
<h2 id="CustomWeapon-AddingMaterials">Adding Materials</h2>
<p>
  The first step in importing to AssMan is to set up your model's materials.
  Open your model in Maya and open Window -&gt; Rendering -&gt; Hypershade. Here
  you can see all of your shader names. You must create a mirror copy of each of
  them in Asset Manager. The material name must match the shader name.
  <strong>GO THOUGH PROCESS OF MATERIAL ADDING HERE.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="CustomWeapon-Addingthexmodel">Adding the xmodel</h2>
<p>
  After adding materials, you can safely add your weapon model. Scroll down to
  'xmodel' and press New Entry. Give the model a name such as viewmodel_gunname
  (although it can be whatever you want - keep it lowercase). For type, choose
  <strong>animated</strong>. In the first Filename box, locate your
  weapon_gunname.xmodel_export and press OK.<br />
  Now go to PC Convert -&gt; Current Asset Only. It should convert successfully.
</p>
<h2 id="CustomWeapon-Addingtheanims">Adding the anims</h2>
<p>
  Now scroll to 'xanim' and press New Entry. Give it a name representative to
  what it is an animation of, for example, viewmodel_gunname_reload_empty.
</p>
<p>For Anim File, navigate to and select your .XANIM_EXPORT file.</p>
<p>
  For Model File, navigate to your <strong>gunsleeve</strong> .xmodel_export.
  Leave notetrack blank unless you know what you are doing.
  <strong>Uncheck</strong> Looping and <strong>Uncheck</strong> Use Bones.
  Change <strong>type</strong> to <strong>relative</strong>. Now select PC
  Convert -&gt; Current Asset Only.
</p>
<h1 id="CustomWeapon-WeaponFile">Weapon File</h1>
<p>
  Now you must create a weapon file for your gun. You can use
  <a href="1146972.html">UGX WeaponsEditor++</a> if you wish, or copy/paste a
  treyarch weapon file and edit it to your needs. What is important is that you
  change the value for key 'gunModel' to your xmodel, and the value for the key
  of your desired anim to your anim name. Add the weapon file to
  mods/mapname/weapons/sp.
</p>
<h1 id="CustomWeapon-CSVs&amp;IWD">CSVs &amp; IWD</h1>
<p>
  In order for your xmodel and xanim to show in-game, you must include them in
  fastfiles. Open Launcher and go to the Mod tab. Select your mod from the list
  and then add these lines to the ff box:
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre
      class="syntaxhighlighter-pre"
      data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: cpp; gutter: false; theme: RDark"
      data-theme="RDark"
    >
xanim,nameofxanim
xmodel,nameofxmodel
</pre
    >
  </div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Edit the names to match what you are adding.</p>
<p>Add the same files you included in your FF to your /mods/mapname folders.</p>
