# Roadmap of UGX-Mods Wiki

## Planned ðŸ“ˆ

- GitHub actions to pre-check pull requests
  - formatting, validation, etc.
- Prevent direct push to master (once wiki is stable)
- Some more style / widget elements and fixes
  - Jira elements (status-macro)
  - remove more obsolete confluence boilerplate / cleaner html files
- Fully support markdown (.md) files with tooling
  - atm only .html files are fully supported

## Wishlist âœ¨

- Better navigation, similar to Confluence ðŸ’–
  - might need to wait for wiki.js v3 release
- Better Jira Cloud integration / embed
  - atm there is no real sync and it must be exported + imported and fixed ðŸ˜¢
