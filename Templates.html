      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      KVP is an abbreviation for &quot;Key-Value Pair&quot;. When entering a KVP
      in the Radiant Entity Window,
      <strong>ensure that you have the entity selected first</strong>
      . If you do not have an entity selected, Radiant will automatically add
      the KVP to the &quot;worldspawn&quot; entity. This is BAD and will likely
      cause your map to crash while loading! In these pages, KVP's are referred
      to in this format: Key | Value. Note they are separated by a pipe ( | )
      character. This character should be ignored when entering the Key-Value
      Pair.
      <br />
      <strong>To properly add a KVP to an entity:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select the entity by holding the Shift key on your keyboard followed by
        clicking the entity(ies) that you wish to add a KVP to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the first value (this is the Key) into the text field labeled
        &quot;Key&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the second value (this is the Value) into the text field labaled
        &quot;Value&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the Enter key on your keyboard to save the KVP to the entity. You
        should see the KVP appear in the entity's KVP table (located above the
        Key text field).

      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <strong>&quot;mapname.gsc&quot;</strong>
      refers to your map's main gsc file, which is named the same name as your
      map.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a map called &quot;nazi_zombie_example&quot; would have a
      mapname.gsc named &quot;nazi_zombie_example.gsc&quot;. This file is
      commonly used to call custom scripts for a map.

      Lines which precache items such as models need to be called BEFORE the

      any items should be called AFTER the gamestate starts and should be
      threaded.

        For Precache Lines, add them
        <strong>before</strong>
        the gamestate line.

      <li>
        For Thread Lines, add them

      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <strong>&quot;Prefab&quot;</strong>
      is shorthand for &quot;prefabrication&quot;. A prefab is a pre-assembled
      group of brushes, models, or terrain patches which can be placed and moved
      as a group in Radiant.
      <br />
      <strong>To Place a Prefab:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click the 2D Window in Radiant.</li>
      <li>Navigate to misc -&gt; prefab</li>
      <li>
        Use the file browser to navigate to the desired prefab, which should
        always be located in root/map_source/_prefabs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you have a prefabricated group of objects which can be moved around
        as if it were one object.

      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      &quot;targeting&quot; is a method for linking entities together in a
      group. Targeting has menu useful applications, such as controlling an
      entity that has multiple pieces. For example, the Mystery Box uses
      targeting to link each separate script_model part of the box to the main
      trigger_use. Targeting generates automatic targetname and target KVP's on
      the affected entities. When two items are properly linked together, a red
      or blue line is drawn from the main entity to each of its targets/links in
      Radiant.
      <br />
      <strong>To properly target one item to another:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Determine which of the affected entities is going to be the &quot;root
        entity&quot;. The root entity is the entity that will be referenced by
        name in script. Root entities are found in script by using
        getEnt(&quot;root_entity_targetname&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);.
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine which of the affected entities is going to be the target/link.
        The target/link entity(ies) are the &quot;children&quot; of the root
        entity and do not need specific targetnames. Target/link entities are
        found in script by using getEnt(root_entity.target,
        &quot;targetname&quot;);
      </li>
      <li>Deselect all items by pressing ESC on your keyboard</li>
      <li>
        Select the
        <strong>root entity</strong>
        first.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, select
        <strong>one</strong>
        of the target/link entities and press W on your keyboard. This will
        create the link between the two entities. Repeat this step for all
        target/link children of the root entity until all entities have red or
        blue lines connecting them to the root entity.
      </li>
    </ul>
