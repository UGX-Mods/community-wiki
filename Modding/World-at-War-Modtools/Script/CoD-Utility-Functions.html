<h2 id="CoDUtilityFunctions-CoDUtilityFunctions">CoD Utility Functions</h2>
<p>
  There are a number of CoD-specific utility functions that you will find
  useful. They can ALL be found here:
  <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/script/">https://ugx-mods.com/script/</a>
  . There are also other functions that Treyarch wrote for CoD5 and IW wrote for
  CoD4 that can be found in the raw/maps folder of your CoD5/CoD4 installation.
  The most used utility function is probably the getEnt() function, which is
  explained below:

  So you want to move that purple box 10ft in the air and then make it
  disappear? Wow, that's really stupid, man. Why would you want to do that? Did
  you seriously just spend 45 minutes reading this guide page to accomplish
  that?
</p>
<p>Just kidding! On with the actual info:</p>
<p>
  Acquiring entities is easy. You use getEnt(value, key) to get one ent (and
  there must only be one of that name!) and getEntArray(value,key) to get a
  group of ents with the same name. Most of the time, your key will be
  &quot;targetname&quot; and your value will be whatever you assigned it in
  Radiant, although you can acquire ents using other key/value pairs as well
  (but the question is why bother). To acquire any ent, it
  <strong>
    MUST BE SET AS A SCRIPT_MODEL (XMODEL) OR SCRIPT_BRUSHMODEL (BRUSH) IN ORDER
    TO BE SEEN BY SCRIPT.
  </strong>
  Read that sentence like 5 times. Maybe 10. Seriously. It's
  <em>REALLY</em>
  important that you understand that and that you don't forget it.

            Converts string-formatted numbers to integers. This is helpful when
            you are doing math with strings and it doesn't perform as expected.

            Usually called on triggers, it pauses execution flow until a notify
            is cast on whatever entity the waittill has been called on.
            Optionally, you can define a variable to represent whoever caused
            the event (commonly 'player'). If the waittill() is not cast on an
            entity, it waits for a general notify. Can also be used with the
            'level' entity for cross-script notifies.
