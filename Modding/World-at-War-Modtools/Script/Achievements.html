<p>
  I wasn't sure if i should release this because this tutorial might look a bit
  complicated, and i'm not sure if people even want to add this to their maps..
  But in the end it's really easy to use and i had it laying around anyways, so
  i decided to post this. Just read carefully step by step and i hope it's
  understandable. Adding achievements just takes 2 or 3 lines of code!
</p>
<p>
  This script will allow you to put achievements in your map, their stats will
  save between games. For example when you add an achievement: &quot;Kill 100
  zombies&quot; and a player gets 75 kills, then dies and starts a new game and
  get 25 kills he will earn the achievement. 
</p>
<p>
  When a player unlocks an achievement a message shows up on screen, and you can
  choose to also have an icon appear, a sound play, and have points rewarded.
</p>
<p>
  You can add your own achievements for your map pretty simple, anything like
  'Kill X amount of zombies' or 'Kill a boss without jugg' or 'Open 50 doors' or
  whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
  For now the player will just get the message on screen once, and it will be
  &quot;unlocked&quot;. There's no menu to view your achievements or anything
  like that ( yet, might do it depending on if people actually use this.. )
</p>
<hr />
<p>1.</p>
<p>
  Lets get started, first download the files and put them in the correct folder.
  One goes into your \RAW\mp\ folder, and the other in your \MODS\mapname\maps\
  folder.
</p>
<hr />
<p>2.</p>
<p>
  Open your _zombiemode.gsc and around line 60-70 you'll see similar line's, add
  this one:
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
maps\_blst_achievements::init();</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p>3.</p>
<p>
  to include the stringtable-csv in your mod, add this line to the mod.csv in
  your mod-builder-tab on launcher;
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
stringtable,mp/my_achievements.csv</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>4.</p>
<p>
  if you want to use (custom) shaders for the achievement-notify's, add the
  materials to a .csv and make sure the images are included in your mod! They
  will be precached automaticly by the script, so no need to worry about that.
</p>
<hr />
<p>5.</p>
<p>Now how to setup you own achievements: </p>
<div class="banner banner-info">
  <img

    alt=""
    class="banner-icon" />

  <div class="banner-body">
    <p>
      <strong>
        <span style="white-space: normal">
           I left two examples in the files so its easier to understand. You can
          just remove / change those as you wish.
        </span>
      </strong>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>First a short explanation to clear things up:</p>
<p>
  You can add multiple 'levels' for one achievement, for example you can add one
  for killing 10 zombies and then also one for killing 25 zombies.
</p>
<p>
  Obviously those are 'the same' achievement( ...they are related to the same
  stat -&gt; zombie kills ) so to tell the game they are the same stat but a
  different achievement you'll need to add two 'names' for each achievement you
  add. One is called the 'name' and the other the 'ref'!
</p>
<p>
   * The achievement NAME, wich should be the same for all achievements that
  relate to the same stat! So in the example above both could be named:
  kills_all
</p>
<p>
   * The achievement REF, wich should be different for all achievements! so in
  the example above it could be: kills_all_1 and kills_all_2
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  Make sure you pay attention to that, then adding achievements is going to be
  easy  :)
</p>
<hr />
<p>6.</p>
<p>
  Open the file you copied to raw\mp\ named: my_achievements.csv it basicly
  works the same as a soundalias. This just stores stuff like strings. You need
  to add every achievement you want to use in your map here.
</p>
<p>this is an example of a line from that file:</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
1,kills_all,kills_all_1,Kill 10 zombies,2105,10,250,specialty_juggernaut_zombies,</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  In the following order ( the bold text between the braces refers to the
  example line above )
</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
  <table class="confluenceTable">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center" class="confluenceTd">0</td>
        <td class="confluenceTd">

          <em><strong>(1)</strong></em>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="confluenceTd">1</td>
        <td class="confluenceTd">
          <span style="white-space: normal">
            Achievement NAME ( see explanation in the previous step ) 
            <em><strong>(kills_all)</strong></em>
          </span>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="confluenceTd">2</td>
        <td class="confluenceTd">

      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p> </p>

<p>
  Next open the _blst_achievements.gsc, at the top you'll see the line's to
  setup the achievements. If you want a sound to play when a player unlocks an
  achievement, change it in this line:
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
level.achievement_sound = &quot;none&quot;;</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Next to tell the script wich achievements to add, copy this line once for
  every achievement you added, and edit it: Fill in the correct achievement REF
  for every achievement you want to add ( &quot;kills_all_1&quot; in the example
  below )
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
level.custom_achievements[level.custom_achievements.size] = &quot;kills_all_1&quot;;</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p>8.</p>
<p>
  That's everything to setup the script, but now comes the hard part. You need
  to make the game keep track of the achievements you added. For example if you
  add an achievement 'Use the mystery box 5 times' you need to edit the
  box-script, and make the game count the stats.
</p>
<p>You can do that by adding the following line in a script:</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
self maps\_blst_achievements::add_to_my_stat( &quot;use_box_5_times&quot;, 1 );</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  In this line 'self' is the player! You need to fill in the correct achievement
  NAME ( not ref! ). The '1' tells the game to add 1 to the stat. It will
  automaticly check for achievement-unlocks every time you use that line so no
  need to add anything else.
</p>
<p>
  For some people this will be the hard part to figure out, i'll try to help out
  if needed in the topic below. In the download i allready made the 'zombie
  kills' achievement work, the one for opening doors does not work! It's just an
  example!! If you want to make that work, you need to add the line mentioned
  above in _zombiemode_blockers_new for each door/debris trigger.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Last thing, in the _blst_achievements.gsc there's one level. var at the top
  called: level.map_testing
  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre"> </span>
  If you set that to true, it will use prints to display your current stats so
  you can easily test stuff, and at game start you have the option to reset your
  stats.
