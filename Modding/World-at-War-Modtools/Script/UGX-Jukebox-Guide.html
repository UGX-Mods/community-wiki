<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-Download">Download</h2>
<p>
  Download the UGX Jukebox installation files here:
  <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/downloads/UGX%20Jukebox%20v1.0.4.rar">
    UGX Jukebox v1.0.4.rar (25.1MB)
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Extract the archive to it's own folder anywhere using WinRAR or equivalent.
  <br />
  Navigate into the mods/ folder and
  <strong>rename the MAPNAME folder to the name of your map's folder</strong>
  in your root directory (example: nazi_zombie_testmap)
</p>
<h3 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-Changelog">Changelog</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    v1.0.4: Moved all songs to the &quot;music&quot; channel in the soundalias
    so that volume can be changed with the music slider in World at War's audio
    options.
  </li>
  <li>
    v1.0.3: Fixed a bug where you receive a gun with full ammo back after the
    button pushing anim plays for the box, instead of reviving your current ammo
    back.
  </li>
  <li>
    v1.0.2: Fixed a bug where if the wait for power setting was enabled, the
    Jukebox would never turn on. Fixed a bug where dynamically adding a song did
    not work.
  </li>
  <li>
    v1.0.1: Fixed a visual menu bug where at certain screen resolutions the
    Jukebox menu would appear jumbled.
  </li>
  <li>v1.0.0: Release.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-Installation">Installation</h1>
<p>
  The first step to installing the Jukebox is adding the files to your root
  directory. highlight the &quot;map_source&quot;, &quot;mods&quot;,
  &quot;raw&quot;, and &quot;sound_assets&quot; folders from the archive and
  drag them into your root directory. It should merge with your existing
  folders. If not, you did it wrong!
</p>
<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-CallingtheFunctions">Calling the Functions</h2>
<p>
  You need to add two lines to your mapname.gsc before the Jukebox will run.
  <br />
</p>
<div class="banner banner-tip">
  <img src="/attachments/icons/check-decagram.png" alt="" class="banner-icon" />

  <div class="banner-body">
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <strong>&quot;mapname.gsc&quot;</strong>
      refers to your map's main gsc file, which is named the same name as your
      map.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a map called &quot;nazi_zombie_example&quot; would have a
      mapname.gsc named &quot;nazi_zombie_example.gsc&quot;. This file is
      commonly used to call custom scripts for a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lines which precache items such as models need to be called BEFORE the
      gamestate starts and should not be threaded. Lines which do not precache
      any items should be called AFTER the gamestate starts and should be
      threaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The gamestate is started by this line in mapname.gsc:</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left">
      <div class="cpp source-cpp">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>To add lines to your mapname.gsc:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open your mapname.gsc file, which can be found in
        <strong>root/mods/mapname/maps</strong>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        For Precache Lines, add them
        <strong>before</strong>
        the gamestate line.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Thread Lines, add them
        <strong>after</strong>
        the gamestate line.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-Configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>
  The Jukebox has some basic configuration settings that can be changed if you
  wish. The default settings do not require the power switch to be on for the
  Jukebox to work, and charge 10 points per song play.
</p>
<h3 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-PowerNeeded">Power Needed</h3>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
level.jukebox[&quot;power_needed&quot;] = false;</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Changing this setting to true will display a &quot;Power must be on.&quot;
  message to players until the power switch is flipped in the map, preventing
  players from using the Jukebox until the power is on.
</p>
<h3 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-Cost">Cost</h3>

level.jukebox[&quot;cost&quot;] = 10;</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Changing this setting will change the amount of points players are charged
  each time they play a song from the Jukebox.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-RadiantPlacement">Radiant Placement</h2>
<p>
  To place one or more Jukeboxes in your map, use the prefab
  <strong>root/map_source/_prefabs/ugx_mod/ugx_jukebox.map</strong>
  .
  <br />
</p>
<div class="banner banner-tip">
  <img src="/attachments/icons/check-decagram.png" alt="" class="banner-icon" />

  <div class="banner-body">
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <strong>&quot;Prefab&quot;</strong>
      is shorthand for &quot;prefabrication&quot;. A prefab is a pre-assembled
      group of brushes, models, or terrain patches which can be placed and moved
      as a group in Radiant.
      <br />
      <strong>To Place a Prefab:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click the 2D Window in Radiant.</li>
      <li>Navigate to misc -&gt; prefab</li>
      <li>
        Use the file browser to navigate to the desired prefab, which should
        always be located in root/map_source/_prefabs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you have a prefabricated group of objects which can be moved around
        as if it were one object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To stamp a prefab, select the prefab and press the
      <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5mfwdPu.png">

      button from the toolbar.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<br />
The prefab does not need to be stamped to work. There is no limit to how many
Jukeboxes can be placed in a single map.

<p>
  <strong>You are finished!</strong>
  You can now boot your map and enjoy the UGX Jukebox.
</p>
<h1 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-AddingCustomSongs">Adding Custom Songs</h1>
<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-SongFiles">Song Files</h2>
<p>
  If you plan to use your own songs in the Jukebox instead of the default
  non-copyright songs, you will need to convert them. Later we will have a page
  which teaches you all about converting sounds and creating soundaliases - but
  until then, you're on your own. The process is the same as you would use for
  any other music box. If you have already converted some songs for use with a
  different music box script, you may reuse them without changing anything.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-ScriptConfiguration">Script Configuration</h2>
<p>
  To add your custom songs to the Jukebox, you first need to open
  <strong>root/mods/MAPNAME/maps/ugx_jukebox.gsc.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Inside the jukebox_settings() function, you will find the default songs
  defined on line 19. There is a function called add_song() which adds songs to
  the Jukebox and its menu.
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
add_song(display_name, soundalias_name)
{
	level.jukebox[&quot;songs&quot;][display_name][&quot;name&quot;] = soundalias_name;
}</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  The first argument is the song's display name which shows on the Jukebox menu.
  The second argument is the soundalias name, which is the soundalias name that
  corresponds to the display name. Replace the default songs on line 19 with
  your own. The Jukebox menu will only display a maximum of 10 songs, regardless
  of how many you add in the script file. This limit is imposed mainly because
  it is an inconvenience to players if they have to download a map file that is
  400mb large because the mapper thought it was cool to add 40 uncompressed
  songs to the map.
</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="banner banner-warning">
  <img src="/attachments/icons/alert-octagon.png" alt="" class="banner-icon" />

  <div class="banner-body">
    <strong>Warning:</strong>
    If you are adding songs which are not copyright-free, PLEASE change the
    youtube_safe setting to false on line 16 inside the jukebox_settings
    function. This will disable the &quot;COPYRIGHT FREE&quot; message on the
    Jukebox menu, notifying players that a song that they play may trigger a
    copyright notice on YouTube. This is purely a courtesy to players.
  </div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>
  It is not necessary to modify the menu file at all, it will load the song
  names dynamically. You are done after modifying the script file.
</p>
<h1 id="UGXJukeboxGuide-DynamicallyAddSongsIn-Game">
  Dynamically Add Songs In-Game
</h1>
<p>
  It is also possible to have the Jukebox start with a limited amount of songs,
  and then by calling the add_song() function at any time during gameplay you
  could add a song to the menu, since it is dynamic. For instance, you could
  create an objective system for finding CD's scattered around the map - each CD
  unlocks a new song in the Jukebox! It's up to you to code these events,
  obviously. Here is an example function call:
