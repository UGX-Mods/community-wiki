  This tutorial will cover the creation of a working map within World at War.
  This tutorial assumes you already have a working mod tools installation
  updated to v1.4. If you do not have a working mod tools installation you can
  find a tutorial for downloading and installing the tools

    target="_blank">
    Here.

</p>

<ul>

<h1 id="CreatingaMap-UsingtheScriptPlacer">Using the Script Placer</h1>
<p>
  If you do not already have the UGX Script Placer you can download it from the
  link above.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    (Windows 7+) Right click the .EXE file you downloaded and click &quot;Run as
    Administrator&quot;.
    <br />
    (Windows XP) Double click the .EXE file you downloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon opening you will see a basic interface which might look somewhat
    confusing at first glance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To get more comfortable with the script placer I will explain what the basic
  functions are and what they mean for you. If you already have an understanding
  of the functions the script placer performs then you can skip this
  explanation.

<p><strong>Cheats Options</strong></p>
<p>
  Disable Console - This disallows any player to be able to use console commands
  while using your map. This significantly reduces the amount of cheating
  possible when your map is played.
</p>
<p>
  Disable Godmode - This disallows any player to enable God Mode. An ability in
  which the player can never die.
</p>
<p>
  Disable UFO/Noclip - This disallows any player to enable UFO or Noclip. Both
  commands allow players to move about the map freely and go places they usually
  wouldn't be able to go, such as inside walls and outside map boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  Disable Notarget - This disallows any player to enable Notarget. Notarget is a
  command that when enabled cannot be seen by AI. When the command is activated
  all enemy AI fighting against the player will lose knowledge that the player
  exists.
</p>
<p>
  Create Main Menu Launch Button - This creates a button on the game's main menu
  that when clicked will start your map. Usually the map would need to be
  started from the console. This is required when disabling the console as
  otherwise the player wouldn't be able to start the map.
</p>
<p>
  Kill Players For Leaving Playable Area - This option is not yet finished and
  will be added in a later version of the script placer.
</p>
<p><strong>Map Start</strong></p>
<p>
  Blank Map - Creates a blank map file. Your map will have nothing inside of it
  when the script placer creates it.
</p>
<p>
  Sniperbolt's Tutorial - This is a test map with all the features of v1.4
  included. The map has basic functionality with player spawns, zombie spawns,
  teleporters, perk machines, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Special FX</strong></p>
<p>
  These options are not yet finished and will be added in a later version of the
  script placer.
</p>
<p><strong>Screens</strong></p>
<p>
  Loadscreen - The background image the players will view when loading the level
  in a co-op lobby.
</p>
<p>
  Solo Load. - The background image the player will view when loading the level
  solo.
</p>
<p>
  Missionscreen - The thumbnail preview image the players will view in the
  bottom left corner when in a co-op lobby.
</p>
<p>
  Pausescreen - The image which will be shown in the menu when the player
  presses pause in game.
