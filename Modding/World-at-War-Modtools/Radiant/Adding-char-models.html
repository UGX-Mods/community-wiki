<h1 id="Addingcharmodels-Maya">Maya</h1>
<p>Rig up the model in Maya using either the CoD4 or CoD5 charmesh</p>
<h1 id="Addingcharmodels-AssMan">AssMan</h1>
<p>Set your char xmodel to the type 'animated'.</p>
<p>Set your char xanim to these settings:</p>
<p>Anim File: Your XANIM_EXPORT that contains the anim</p>
<p>
  Model File: XMODEL_EXPORT that contains the unedited pose of the skeleton with
  joints (doesn't have to be your model, can be any model that contains the same
  joints as the rig, or an export of the rig itself. I just export
  CoD_DefMesh.mb)
</p>
<p>Done.</p>
