<ul>
  <li>Reflection Probes count as 1 image each</li>
  <li>
    Removing iwi's from your IWD does absolutely nothing towards lowering the
    image asset count for the engine error. The 2400 count is images included by
    fastfile-loaded assets only. IWI images are not loaded into engine memory
    which is why they don't count.
  </li>
  <li>
    Duplicate includes of the same image count as only a single slot total used.
  </li>
  <li>
    The &quot;real&quot; limit is somewhere around 2358 images due to images
    embedded in fastfiles and engine assets which cannot be removed.
  </li>
</ul>
