    (or equivalent .zip archive capable program)

  Step 1): Gathering Files
</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure your map has been compiled successfully and works bug free in
      game, as you want other users to experience it
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the directory
    &quot;C:\Users*USERNAME\AppData\Local\Activision\CoDWaW\mods&quot;. If you
    can't find the appdata folder you can open your start menu, type
    &quot;run&quot; and press enter. Then in the window that appears type
    &quot;appdata&quot; and press enter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find your maps folder, it will be called the same thing that you called it
    when you created the map. Ex. &quot;nazi_zombie_420&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on your maps folder and click &quot;Add to archive&quot;</li>
  <li>
    Once WinRAR opens make sure the selection is on &quot;zip&quot; format and
    press OK.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <img height="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/UV81WR3.png" alt />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Once you have pressed OK in WinRAR it will create a new .zip file with the
    name of your map in your mods directory. As to avoid having loose files
    there copy the .zip file to another location such as your desktop.
  </li>
  <li>
    (OPTIONAL) If you are using an SP loadscreen drop it onto the archive to add
    it to the zip. The installer will detect the &quot;_load&quot; suffix and
    place it in the user's &quot;main/video&quot; directory.
  </li>
</ul>

  Step 2): Creating an Installer
</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open the UGX Installation Creator using the &quot;zip2exe.exe&quot; that is
    included in the Bin folder of the download.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the &quot;Open&quot; button and browse for the zip file that you
    copied to your desktop. Once opened you should see all your map files appear
    within the program.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Under the compression category click &quot;BZip2&quot; and check
    &quot;Solid&quot;.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Now press generate and the .EXE file will be placed in the same location as
    the .zip file you opened, in my case I used my desktop.
  </li>
</ul>
