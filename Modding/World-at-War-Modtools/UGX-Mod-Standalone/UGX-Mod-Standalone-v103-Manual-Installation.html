  Installation Requirements
</h2>
<p>
  Before you begin, there are some requirements to be met before UGX Mod can be
  installed to a map:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You must have access to the source of the map and have the ability to
    compile the map yourself.
    <strong>
      UGX Mod cannot be installed to maps which are already pre-compiled and
      released. UGX Mod needs asset room which requires re-compiling your map's
      ff file.
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Your map must use &quot;version 1.4 Der Riese scripts&quot;. This means that
    your map must be generated using a script placer set to v1.4. This guide
    will assume you are using the
    <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?topic=237.0">
      UGX Script Placer
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    You must have already installed the UGX Modtools Patch from the
    <a href="Modtools-Installation-Guide_1146962.html">
      Modtools Installation Guide
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Your map must not have any modified stock files. For example, if you have
    modified your _zombiemode.gsc or _loadout.gsc, UGX Mod will not work
    properly. In order to keep your custom changes, you must edit the gsc files
    directly by opening either ugx_mod.iwd or ugxm_guns.iwd. Any scripts which
    have not been customized by those two iwds may be edited freely as usual.
    The developers of UGX Mod took extra care to make sure UGX Mod was as
    unintrustive to modders as possible - we tried to keep file overwrites to a
    minimum and keep almost all custom scripting in separate files.
    Unfortunately due to how the engine interfaces with scripts to spawn zombies
    and run zombiemode, this was not possible to do 100%, which is why we
    modified files such as _zombiemode.gsc and _zombiemode_spawner.gsc. All
    custom UGX code is encapsulated in code blocks marked with // UGX_SCRIPT for
    easy identification by modders.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once you have met those requirements, the next step is to download UGX Mod
  Standalone.

</p>
<p>
  Now that you have downloaded UGX Mod Standalone, extract the contents into a
  folder somewhere on your computer (See figure 1).
</p>
<p>
  <code>

  </code>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Fig. 1 UGX Mod Standalone extracted to a folder somewhere.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  You will notice that there are 5 folders and a zip file contained within the
  extracted folder.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    &quot;map_source&quot; contains various prefabs that you will need to add to
    your map later in order to make it compatible with the UGX Random box
    scripts and UGX PaP Machine scripts. There are also wall-weapon prefabs and
    a prefab for a misc_turret, which I will explain later.
  </li>
  <li>
    &quot;mods&quot; contains two folders, &quot;mapname&quot; and
    &quot;ugx_mod&quot;. Rename the &quot;mapname&quot; folder to the name of
    the map you are installing UGX Mod to. In this guide, the mapname I will be
    using is ugx_mod_install. You can use any mapname you want. The mapname
    folder contains pre-compiled ugx_mod assets that your map will need in order
    to run, such as the CoD4/Black Ops/UGX weapons, powerups, and more.
  </li>
  <li>
    &quot;raw&quot; contains images and materials for wall-weapon chalks which
    are necessary for Radiant to display the prefabs. The texture_assets folder
    contains templates for the main menu and loading screen, which I will
    explain later.
  </li>
  <li>

      <div class="banner-body">
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong>
          &quot;zone_source&quot; contains a modified dlc3.csv and
          _zombiemode.csv required for UGX Mod to run. Backups of the original
          files are also provided. In zone_source/english/assetlist, there is a
          file called mapname_ignore.csv. This file, like your mapname folder,
          needs to be renamed to your map. For this guide's example, I will need
          to name this file ugx_mod_install_ignore.csv.
          <strong style="line-height: 1.42857">
            This step is very important, please ensure you have done it

    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    &quot;template_font.zip&quot; contains the .tff font files required to edit
    the PSD templates. Install as you would any font. The font is &quot;Big
    Noodle Tilting&quot;, and can be downloaded free from
    <a href="http://dafont.com">dafont.com</a>

        Do not prefix your mapname with &quot;ugx_&quot;. UGX uses this prefix
        for official maps and if a non-ugx map uses this prefix then it becomes
        confusing to users. If you want to prefix your map with a ugx-related
        word, use &quot;ugxm_&quot;.

        <strong>Warning:</strong>
        You are responsible for backing up any custom work you have done that
        may be overwritten by the installation of UGX Mod. UGX Mod will not
        overwrite anything important for a relatively stock map, but mappers and
        modders should exercise caution by checking for file conflicts before
        attempting this installation. You have been warned - UGX Mods is not
        responsible for any damage done to your installation due to user error
        or negligence. If you have a problem installing UGX Mod, please post a
        topic or reply on our forum for help.

  Now that you have renamed your files and folders from mapname to your map's
  actual name, it is time to copy the files into your root directory:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select all five folders and copy them to your clipboard.</li>
  <li>
    Navigate to your root directory and paste the files. You will be warned
    about folders and files already existing - this is OK - tick the box for
    &quot;Do this for all conflicts&quot; and then press Copy and Replace.
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="banner banner-warning">

  <div class="banner-body">
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong>
      <span>
        If you were not warned about replacing or merging any files or folders,
        you did not paste your files into the correct directory! Pressing Ctrl+Z
        will un-do the latest file action, so hopefully you can use this to
        clean up your mistake. Otherwise you need to delete all the pasted files
        and try again.

  Now that all UGX Mod assets have been copied into your root folder, you are

<p>
  Open root/raw/ui/main.menu with any
  <a href="Text-Editors_1146950.html">Text Editor</a>
  you prefer. At the top of the main.menu file, you will see 3 configurable user
  settings for your map:
</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
  <table class="confluenceTable">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="confluenceTd">
          <strong>UGX_USER_MAPNAME</strong>
        </td>
        <td class="confluenceTd">
          This should be set to the same name you named the mapname folder in

          </a>
          of this guide. It is also the name you use to boot the map from the
          in-game console. If your mod folder name is different from the name
          you use to boot the map (which is unlikely but still works fine), use
          the name of the map , not the of the folder. For this example I will
          need to use &quot;ugx_mod_install&quot;.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="confluenceTd"><strong>UGX_USER_MAPNAME_STRING</strong></td>
        <td class="confluenceTd">
          <span>
            This should be set to the &quot;official&quot; name of your map. For
            this example I will be using &quot;UGX Mod Test Installation&quot;,
            but you may set it to whatever you like.
          </span>

            Setting this to 1 will enable use of the in-game console. Setting it
            to 0 will effectively disable the in-game console. This should be
            set to 1 while developing your map. Once map development is
            finished, I would suggest setting this back to 0 before release -
            otherwise cheating will be very easy on your map, which will make
            player ranks less valuable and meaningful.

<p>
  In this guide I will be using Adobe Photoshop CS5, but any editor capable of
  opening PNG files will do. I suggest using Photoshop so that you can fully
  utilize the provided PSD templates.
</p>
<p>
  Navigate to

  <span>
    and
    <strong> </strong>
  </span>
  Open
  <strong>ugx_mod_main_menu_template.psd</strong>
  <span>, If you are not using Photoshop, open</span>
  <strong>non-photoshop_main_menu.png</strong>
  <span>
    . The PNG will allow you to add a background to the text. I will not cover
    this in the guide, as it is very basic. Instead I will show Photoshop
    editing since I would hope that is what most people choose to do.

  <div class="banner-body">
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong>
      Before I begin editing the template, I would like to draw your attention
      to the UGX-Mods logo and the exiting text. Please do not remove, resize,
      or otherwise edit the UGX-Mods logo or web address that is already placed
      in the template. We spent hundreds if not thousands of hours developing
      UGX Mod, and we are providing it for the community to use for free. All we
      ask in return is that you leave our credit in the menu templates as well
      as make it clear that your map is running UGX Mod when you release it. I
      also do not suggest editing the size or font of the existing main menu
      text, although you are welcome to. It has been specifically positioned and
      sized to match the menu buttons hardcoded in main.menu.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Once you are done editing the template to your liking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    File&gt; Save as a JPG image.
    <strong>Overwrite the existing JPG template file</strong>
    <span>. Close the file.</span>
  </li>
  <li>Open the JPG you just saved.</li>
  <li>Resize the image to 2048x2048. Stretching will occur, ignore that.</li>
  <li>Save your changes and close the file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-LoadscreenImage">
  Loadscreen Image
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open ugx_mod_loadscreen_template.psd, or it's PNG equivalent.</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You may change the background in this file or whatever you would like to
      do. Once again, please leave the existing logos and text alone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Save it the same way you saved the first template,
      <strong>overwriting the loadscreen JPG this time</strong>
      <span>.</span>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-ConvertingtheImages">
  Converting the Images
</h3>
<p>
  Before the changes to the menu images take effect, we need to convert the JPG
  files into a format that CoD5 will read. Open Launcher and then click the
  Asset Manager button.
</p>
<p>In Asset Manager:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click File-&gt;Open, then navigate to
    <strong>root/texture_assets</strong>
    and open
    <strong>ugx_mod_user_assets.gdt</strong>
    . This will populate the asset list in Asset Manager with two entries,
    ugx_main_menu_user and ugx_loadscreen_user.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you overwrite the exiting JPG's correctly in the previous steps, then all
    you need to do here is
    <strong>press F10</strong>
    . It will convert the loadscreen for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once that finishes, press Enter to close the CMD window and then click
    <strong>ugx_main_menu_user</strong>
    from the list. Press F10 and wait for the compile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once that finishes, Press Enter to close the CMD window again. Now you may
    close Asset Manager.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your menu JPGs have now been converted to a format for CoD5, but there is
  still one more step:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Naviagate to
    <strong>root/raw/images</strong>
    <span>
      and sort by Date Modified. At the top of the list you should see two
      files,
    </span>
    <strong>ugx_mod_loadscreen_template.iwi</strong>
    <span>and</span>
    <strong>ugx_mod_menu_template.iwi</strong>
    <span>.</span>
  </li>
  <li><p>Select those two files and copy them to your clipboard.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to
      <strong>root/mods/mapname/images</strong>
      <span>
        . and paste the files. Press Copy and Replace to overwrite the old
        files.
      </span>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Finally to finish the main menu editing we must recompile UGX Mod and your
  maps iwd:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Open Launcher and go to the Mod Builder tab.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select your map from the dropdown list.
      <strong>Ensure that only &quot;Build IWD&quot; is checked</strong>
      <span>, and in the right-side box</span>
      <strong>verify that the new &quot;images&quot; folder is selected</strong>
      <span>.</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Press Build MOD and wait for the process to complete.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select ugx_mod from the dropdown list.
      <strong>Ensure that only Build FF is checked</strong>
      <span>.</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Press Build MOD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-GamemodeSettings">
  Gamemode Settings
</h2>
<p>
  In UGX Mod Standalone there are many gamemode settings which can be changed if
  you wish. The default settings were personally chosen by the developers to
  provide the ideal out-of-the-box experience for developers, but you are free
  to change whatever you wish. If you want to customize the UGX Mod experience
  on your map:
</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open
    <strong>root/mods/mapname</strong>
    <span>(which in my case is ugx_mod_install).</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> </span>
    Double-click
    <strong>ugx_mod.iwd</strong>
    <span>
      to open it with WinRAR. If this is not the default behavor, take the
      necessary action to open the file with WinRAR.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the iwd is open, navigate to the
    <strong>maps folder</strong>
    <span>and double-click the</span>
    <strong>ugx_mod_user_settings.gsc</strong>
    <span>
      file to open it in a
      <a href="Text-Editors_1146950.html">Text Editor</a>
    </span>
    <span>.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This file contains virtually all configurable settings for UGX Mod. Among the
  most popular settings to change will probably be the boss setting and the Gun
  Game gun tier list. All settings in this file have explanations above them or
  beside them. There is also function documentation at the end of the file, so I
  will not go into detail about editing this file. Once you are finished
  editing, save and close the file.
  <strong>
    WinRAR will prompt you to update the file in the archive, select Yes to
    allow this change.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Now you are finished configuring UGX Mod.</p>
<h2 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-AddingyourownScripts">
  Adding your own Scripts
</h2>
<p>
  If you wish to port your custom scripts to UGX Mod, you will want to edit the
  files within
  <strong>ugx_mod.iwd</strong>
  and
  <strong>ugxm_guns.iwd</strong>
  , respectively. Generally if you need to call a custom function or file, you
  can still call them from your mapname.gsc, which is not edited by UGX Mod. UGX
  Mod is cleverly called from early on in the script flow, before the engine
  even runs your mapname.gsc. There is also a function at the end of
  ugxm_user_settings.gsc called post_load(), which you can call scripts from.
  This function runs after the menu gamemode selection has finished and the
  gameplay starts.

<p>
  In order to use random boxes with UGX Mod, you will need to use the provided
  prefabs. There is a prefab for the start box, and then a copy/paste prefab for
  any remaining random boxes. You will also need to use our Pack-a-Punch prefab,
  our wall-weapon chalks, and any other prefabs you find in the later versions
  of UGX Mod Standalone.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-Pack-a-Punch">Pack-a-Punch</h2>
<p>
  If you want to use a PaP machine in your map, you must use our prefab. Keep in
  mind that in order for a PaP machine to work in any map, there must be at
  least one perk machine and a properly placed power switch, which I will not
  cover in this tutorial. If you want to have a moving PaP machine:
</p>
<p> </p>

    For every copy of the prefab you place, you will need to stamp the prefab in
    the map and change one of it's KVPs (See below).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>MultiExcerpt named kvp was not found</b>
  &nbsp;--&nbsp;Please check the page name and MultiExcerpt name used in the
  MultiExcerpt-Include macro
</p>
<p>
  After stamping the prefab, select it's trigger which has the targetname
  <strong>'zombie_vending_upgrade</strong>
  '. You will see the KVP 'script_string' set to zero on each prefab you stamp.
  This is the PaP machine's number. The PaP machine set to zero will spawn
  first, and then any other location will be chosen at random. Select each of
  your PaP prefabs and increase the number by 1 each time. So for five PaP
  locations, you should have a _prefab for each of these script_string numbers:
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4

  . Placing these should be self explanatory. Making your own prefab should also
  be self explanatory.

<p>Now you may save and close your map.</p>
<p>
  Open Launcher and recompile your map in order for the changes to take effect.

  When getting ready to do the first full compile of your new UGX Mod-enabled
  map, you need to create a CoD Project Mover (CPM) file for it. This file is
  basically a project file that you can open whenever you need to compile your
  map. I usually just leave CPM running in the background and switch to it every
  time I need to update my compile.
</p>

    (Right Click, Save As) and save it to somewhere convenient. I like to save
    it to
    <strong>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Activision\CoDWaW\mods</strong>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Open
    <strong>ugx_project_example.cpm</strong>
    with a
    <a href="Text-Editors_1146950.html">Text Editor</a>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace any occurrence of '
      <em>MAPNAME</em>
      ' with your map folder name, and replace any occurrence of '
      <em>USERNAME</em>
      ' with your computer user name (shown on your Start Menu). See Fig. 2.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>

  Lastly you need to compile your UGX Mod mod.ff for the first time, since your
  menu settings and menu images need to be compiled into it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Launcher</li>
  <li>Go to the Mod Builder tab.</li>
  <li>
    Select
    <strong>ugx_mod</strong>
    <span>from the dropdown list.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span> </span>
    Check the box
    <strong>Build mod.ff</strong>
    <span>and</span>
    <strong>uncheck all other boxes</strong>
    <span>.</span>
  </li>
  <li>Press the Build MOD button.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now you have created your UGX Mod mod.ff and are ready to continue to the next
  section. You do not need to repeat the above steps unless you start a new map.

<h2 id="UGXModStandalonev1.0.3ManualInstallation-AfterAnyChangeisMade">

  <span

</p>
<p>
  You will need to do these steps
  <strong>AFTER EVERY COMPILE YOU DO IN LAUNCHER</strong>
  . Even if you are compiling a file that is not relevant to your map, it will
  still break your UGX Mod map until you repeat the below steps.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open CoD Project Mover, which you downloaded earlier. I recommend leaving it
    open in the background, it doesn't take up resources. Later we may modify
    the program to hook into Lauincher itself so that you don't need two
    separate programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    File -&gt; Open, navigate to your renamed CPM file and open it. All the
    settings we changed manually should be shown in the program now. If you do
    not see two files in the list, you did something wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press the Move Files button. It should complete without any errors and only
    takes a second. If you got an error, you make a mistake when creating your
    CPM file.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Done! You are now ready to boot your map.</p>

  If you used the UGX Script Placer to generate your map, there is a known bug
  with UGX Mod due to one of the newer script placer updates. If your map was
  generated before v1.1.3 of the UGX Script Placer then this does not apply to
  you.
</p>
<p>
  An include within your maps CSV generated by the script placer will cause your
  map to be over the sound limit for the engine. Until a patch is generated you
  can fix this by going into &quot;root/zone_source/
  <strong>MAPNAME</strong>
  .csv&quot; and changing this line:
</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
sound,character,nazi_zombie_factory,all_sp</code></pre>

  This call includes dog sounds for v1.4 maps, and is not required for use
  within a UGX-MOD modded map.

      </strong>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  A. It is very important that you make sure your map does not use any gsc files
  which UGX Mod is already modifying. For example, if your mod has it's own
  _loadout.gsc in the iwd, or it's own _zombiemode.gsc, they need to be excluded
  from the iwd compile in order for UGX Mod to work. GSC customizations need to
  be moved into ugx_mod.iwd's _zombiemode.gsc. This should not be difficult for
  most people, since you have to have a basic knowledge of scripting to have
  even modified _zombiemode.gsc in the first place (I would hope).

        Q. How do I compile my map without UGX Mod? I'm done with my UGX Mod

      </strong>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  A.When you want to compile a map without UGX Mod loaded into it, you need to
  rename your &quot;ui&quot; folder to &quot;ui - UGX_MOD&quot; and rename the
  &quot;ui - ORIGINAL&quot; folder to &quot;&quot;ui&quot;. Same goes for
  &quot;ui_mp&quot;. Then you need to go into /root/zone_source/ and rename
  zombiemode.csv to zombiemode.ugx and dlc3.csv to dlc3.ugx, then rename
  zombiemode.original to zombiemode.csv, and dlc3.original to dlc.csv. Lastly
  remove ugx_mod.iwd, ugxm_guns.iwd, localized_common.ff, and
  localized_mapname.ff from your root/mods/mapname folder and appdata/mods
  folder. To go back to UGX Mod compile mode, reverse these steps. You are
  basically just swapping between the stock ui + csv and the ugx_mod ui + csv.

    </p>

<p>
  A. UGX Mod cannot be installed unless you are the developer and compiler of
  the map. You must be using our custom dlc3.csv and zombiemode.csv, and you
  must make sure you properly renamed the
