        The UGX Mod Helper Application and UGX Mod Standalone v1.1 are currently
        in open BETA state! Proceed at your own risk.

  The UGX Mod Helper will guide you though an automated installation of UGX Mod
  Standalone v1.1.x and help you generate new maps which are ready to be
  compiled with UGX Mod enabled on them.
</p>
<p>
  If you would rather
  <em>manually</em>
  install UGX Mod Standalone v1.1.x (
  <strong>not recommended!)</strong>

  If you would like to see exactly what the helper application will be
  extracting into your modtools directory, download the release package manually
  from
  <a href="UGX-Mod-Standalone-v1.1-Manual-Installation-Procedure_7635200.html">
    UGX Mod Standalone v1.1 Manual Installation Procedure
  </a>
  and look inside the zip file. It will be extracted to the root of your
  modtools folder after the helper backs up your ui/ui_mp folder. Remember that
  the UGX Modtools v1.0.7 will also be installed to your modtools directory.

  Step-by-step guide
</h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Download the latest release of the
    <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/downloads/modhelper/UGX%20Mod%20Helper.exe">
      UGX Mod Helper
    </a>
    application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extract it to a location where you are comfortable leaving it. The UGX Mod
    Helper creates a &quot;_resources&quot; directory in the same directory that
    you place UGX Mod Helper.exe.
    <strong>
      If you move or delete this resources directory, the application will need
      to redownload the UGX Modtools Patch and UGX Mod Standalone release
      package.
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you open the UGX Mod Helper, you will currently only be able to use the
    &quot;General Settings&quot; area. More customization options will be
    supported soon.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to Options -&gt; Select Root Directory and ensure that the desired
        modtools installation is set. If not, change it and click OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter your map folder name - you should use the same name as your map
        file if you have already created one. Otherwise this can be anything you
        want.
        <strong>
          We suggest using the ugxm_ prefix for all maps created with UGX Mod
          v1.1.x for community organization's sake, although this is up to you.
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter the display name for your map. This is the text that will be
        displayed in the lower left corner of the screen when you start the
        game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specify your map source file. I suggest using the Custom Map option
        instead of the Setup Map, as the setup map is very bare. We will update
        it later.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Press &quot;Generate Map&quot; to finish the process.
    <ol>
      <li>
        If you do not already have the UGX Modtools Patch installed, it will be
        installed for you now.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not already have the UGX Mod Standalone v1.1.x release package
        installed, you will be asked if you want to install it now.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Done!
    <strong>
      If your map was generated with errors, you can likely ignore this for now.
    </strong>
    This is just a logging bug that will be fixed in a later beta version of the
    UGX Mod Helper.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now you need to compile your map as you normally would - build the map and
  patch on the Compile Maps tab of Launcher, then build the mod.ff and mod.iwd
  on the Mod Builder tab of Launcher. Once you've compiled your map you can boot
  it!
  <strong>No Project Mover required.</strong>

  <div class="banner-body">
    I plan to add a feature that allows you to swap your modtools install
    between compiling UGX Mod and non-UGX Mod maps by the press of a button, but
    I don't want to waste time developing that until the rest of the application
    has been finalized.
