<p>
  On and off I've spent the last month or so figuring out how to extract sounds
  from Ghosts. I can't find an exporter nor can I find any info on the FFs. So I
  just decided to figure it out myself.

      NOTE: There is no guarantee you can get the sounds with this method, but
      you have a fairly good chance. I was able to extract sounds including
      fire, clip ins, etc. for Bulldog and Magnum.

  This tutorial is a little full on so take it step by step, if you need
  assistance I'm usually on Chat of just ask here. Don't look at it and think 2
  complex 4 me, it really isn't. If I the idiot could figure it out you can
  follow these instructions. If you think I've gone wrong anywhere here please
  let me know, pretty sure I didn't skip any parts as I pretty much typed as I
  ported the sound. :D
</p>
<p>Some things you'll need before starting:</p>

<h1 id="RipsoundsfromIW6-DecompilingtheFF">Decompiling the FF</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  To begin, we're going to need to decompile the FF. This involves determining
  which FF the gun sounds are in, I usually go by SP ones if the gun is in SP
  since I find it easy because fewer weapons are in one level, your preference,
  if it's in MP only (including DLC ones) make sure to use MP ff's.
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to rip the sounds for the Bulldog, note that make sure to go on Wiki
  and find out the name of the gun in game files, the Bulldog for example is
  referred to as Maul, not Bulldog. The Bulldog is in a few levels, but I am
  going to extract it from No Man's Land aka nml.ff.
</p>
<p>
  So open FF Viewer 3.0 and drop the FF onto it, it will take a bit to extract,
  so be patient and wait until it exports fully, if you get any errors let me
  know, but I haven't got any yet.

  </span>
</p>
<p>If it says success, great, leave it open until we're done.</p>
<p>You should now have this file in the same folder as the FF:</p>

</p>
<p>Now we can move onto getting the sounds.</p>
<h1 id="RipsoundsfromIW6-RippingtheSounds">Ripping the Sounds</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  This is where it gets bit confusing maybe, and requires some thinking. Open
  the .dat file in HxD and it should look similar to this (not 100% exact
  obviously):
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/3e8af861a9bb2e76bbaf1ff24bea810e.png"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/3e8af861a9bb2e76bbaf1ff24bea810e.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Try not the get confused, k? So let's search for the sound, remember I told
  you to take note of the weapons in-files name? Press CTRL+F to search and
  search for it.
</p>
<p>You'll probably run into this stuff:</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/33b9a510e1f73e360d4a07fc7a289c07.png"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/33b9a510e1f73e360d4a07fc7a289c07.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Ignore them and press F3 to skip to another entry, they are joint names
  probably, possibly for anims/models. Also skip ones with mtl_, nrm, col, spc
  etc. in the name, materials ant texture names. Also stuff like _lod. I usually
  find the audio section of the .dat to be located about below mid-way with the
  slider at the side.
</p>
<p>
  Go until you find something named simialr to this, with npc, plr, etc. at the
  end, as this is probably a soundalias name, we are getting close.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/bbfeedb0c75c975e752f461d24aa526a.png"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/bbfeedb0c75c975e752f461d24aa526a.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Now keep skipping these, as we don't need them, but they give us an idea of
  where we are, wait until we get down to something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/4e143df2869f1dceecda01045237112a.png"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/4e143df2869f1dceecda01045237112a.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  This is probably a sound, put the cursor after the dot at the end and take
  note of the offset.
</p>
<p>
  Now since the alias and sounds are usually jumbled together in this, do
  another search for your weapon to bring you to the next entry, which as we see
  is probably an alias, take note of the part before the alias name like we done
  with the dot after our sound name.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/e9306b1c9315a7ca5290c4fc738aa489.png"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/e9306b1c9315a7ca5290c4fc738aa489.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Now with the 2 offsets you've taken note off, press CTRL+E or Edit&gt;Select
  Block, this will allow us to select the entire section that is possibly the
  audio.
</p>
<p>
  We shall enter the first offset we took into the Start, and the last on, into
  the End and press Ok, this will select the entire block like so:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img
      class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
      draggable="false"
      src="https://i.gyazo.com/6b8ee8ed92b9d5d83cd457732aae8fbe.gif"
      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/6b8ee8ed92b9d5d83cd457732aae8fbe.gif" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Now copy this, if you copy too much don't worry, we can always chop it off in
  Audacity. :)
</p>
<p>
  Now make a new file in HxD and paste it in, if it gives a warning about File
  Size being bigger, press Ok. Now you can save this to where ever, file
  extension doesn't matter either.
</p>

    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Now you can keep repeating this step for different sounds, like this is clip
  in, we can do another search for clip_out, fire etc. :)
</p>
<h2 id="RipsoundsfromIW6-Justanotherdemonstrationwithabitlessdetail:">
  Just another demonstration with a bit less detail:
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>
  From where we are, search again for what might look like a sound, again, keep
  going until you find it (usually reload sounds will be foley/soundname and it
  is probably only a few lines under our first block for the clip in):
</p>

    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>Take note of the first offset, the dot after the name:</p>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow">
    <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
      <img
        class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"

    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Then search again, and take note of the offset of the dot before this alias
  name:
</p>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow">
    <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
      <img
        class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
        draggable="false"
        src="https://i.gyazo.com/b846f56cd284f27c79eccf28a5e4b4b5.png"
        data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/b846f56cd284f27c79eccf28a5e4b4b5.png" />
    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>Then select the block like we done before:</p>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow">
    <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
      <img
        class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
        draggable="false"
        src="https://i.gyazo.com/dd8696e7ac7b0bd486de68dd3178237f.png"
        data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/dd8696e7ac7b0bd486de68dd3178237f.png" />
    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>And paste into a new file and save.</p>
<p>Do that for whatever sounds you want.</p>
<p>
  Now once you're done, we can move onto importing these files into Audacity
</p>
<h1 id="RipsoundsfromIW6-ImportingtheSounds">Importing the Sounds</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  This is by far the easiest part. Just open Audacity, go to Import&gt;Raw Data
  and select the file to import:
</p>
<p>
  <a rel="nofollow">
    <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
      <img
        class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
        draggable="false"
        src="https://i.gyazo.com/6b98be55c82687764d6316f3457eb0a7.gif"
        data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/6b98be55c82687764d6316f3457eb0a7.gif" />
    </span>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Once that's done assuming you done it right, it should work. :) After that
  it's just exporting it to WaW, which you can learn about in another tutorial
  (Zeroy's Wiki has some good tuts for sounds for both IW3 and T4).

  Happy modding, enjoy your sounds if you are successful with it, make sure to
  trim off any bad sound if there is some. :)
