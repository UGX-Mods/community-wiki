<h2 id="GuidetoSoundsandSoundaliases-Soundalias">Soundalias</h2>
<p>
  A soundalias is an alias which points to a sound file. You can have multiple
  soundaliases that point to the same sound file. Soundaliases allow you to
  apply manipulations to the soundfile such as volume/pitch change.

  Common Misconceptions
</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    &quot;I can just copy/paste soundalias lines from one file to another and
    have them work.&quot;
    <br />
    Unless the header line of the soundalias file matches the source soundalias
    file, the soundalias will not work. In addition, soundalias lines have many
    settings which should not just be generically copied to every sound you
    import. For instance, a weapon soundalias will play on the weapon bus with
    ~0.7 volume and depending on if it's a player or npc alias, it might be set
    to be a 3d 3rd person sound. This is bad and should be avoided. Take the
    time to determine the correct settings for your sound!

<h2 id="GuidetoSoundsandSoundaliases-CompressionMethods">
  Compression Methods
</h2>
<p>By default, MODSound is going to produce only uncompressed sound.</p>
<p>If you want to enable compressed sound, here is what you need to do:</p>
<p>
  1. Have the DirectX SDK installed. (March 2008 or later required)
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812">
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  2. Make sure that your DirectX SDK Utilities\bin\x86 folder is in the PATH
  environment variable.
</p>
<p>To set it from the command line use this:</p>
<p>set PATH=%DXKSDK_DIR%\Utilities\Bin\x86;%PATH%</p>
<p>Two tools are used from that folder AdpcmEncode.exe and WMAEncode.exe</p>
<p>
  As an alternative to adding PATH to your folder, you can copy these two tools
  to the same directory where MODSound.exe is.
</p>
<p>
  3. Download the open-sourced SOX tool (Sound-Exchange) and place it in the
  same directory where MODSound.exe.
</p>
<p>You can download prebuilt sox executable from here:</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sox/sox-14.0.1.zip?download">
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sox/sox-14.0.1.zip?download
  </a>
</p>
<p>You need only sox.exe from the archive.</p>
<p>
  Take a look for more up to date version into
  <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage">
    http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  4. Even without sox.exe you can still use compression, but it won't always be
  able to use xWMA.
</p>
<p>
  xWMA has a strict requirments on what the sample rate of the wave files are,
  and sox is being used to resample these in case the requirment is not met.
</p>

<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Anytime you type MODSound -help it'll bring up help screen.</p>
