WeaponsEditor++ is a program written by
<em>Andy King</em>
which can be used to directly edit CoD4/5 weaponFiles in a drag-and-drop
fashion. It can also be used to convert BO1 weaponFiles for use in CoD4/5.
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can open any weaponfile with the program, no GDTs necessary.</li>
  <li>
    You can find any weaponfile setting within seconds using the Search for
    Setting feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can edit any weaponfile type (bullet, projectile, grenade, gas, turret)
    without changing any program settings - it will detect what settings to
    display.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can base a new weaponfile off of an existing one by using the Save As
    feature and/or Advanced Mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can save changes to the currently opened weaponfile by using the Save
    feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    All settings have tooltips which describe what the setting does - some are
    taken directly from Asset Manager, others are new or rewritten to be more
    useful and descriptive.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can navigate to your root/mods or root/raw/weapons folder using the
    convenient buttons on the side of the window.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will be notified if any updates are available to the application using
    the automatic update check upon launch of the program.

</p>
<h2 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-OpeningaweaponFileforEditing">
  Opening a weaponFile for Editing
</h2>
<p>
  Open UGX WeaponsEditor++.exe. Open a Windows Explorer window and navigate to
  wherever your weaponFile is which you would like to edit. All the stock World
  at War weaponFiles are in root/raw/weapons/sp, but don't edit them there! Copy
  them to your root/mods/mapname/weapons/sp folder to edit them.
</p>
<p>
  Drag the desired weaponFile onto the &quot;Drop Zone&quot; of UGX
  WeaponsEditor++.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    As of v1.0.0 of the program there are additional ways of opening
    weaponFiles:
  </strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the Open option under the File menu.</li>
  <li>
    Pressing CTRL+O on your keyboard to open the Open option from the File menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dragging the weaponFile onto any part of the UGX WeaponsEditor++ program
    window.
  </li>
  <li>Dragging the weaponFile onto the UGX WeaponsEditor++ exe itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have opened a valid weaponFile, the program will be populated with
  all of the settings for the weapon. You can freely make any desired changes
  without worrying about the original file being overwritten - changes will only
  be saved if you use the Save button.
</p>

<h2 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-FindingSettings">Finding Settings</h2>
<h3 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-UsingtheSearchBox">Using the Search Box</h3>
<p>
  UGX WeaponsEditor++ has a search feature to quickly jump to settings. This
  should be a major productivity boost for anyone who is editing the same
  setting(s) for multiple files
</p>
<p>
  To use the search box, simply start typing the name of the setting. If an
  exact match for the setting is found, it will be displayed directly in the
  searchbox. Any close matches will be displayed in a dropdown box below the
  search. You can click any of the settings you see to select them for the
  search box. Hit enter to jump to the setting.
</p>
<h3 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-ReadingtheTooltips">Reading the Tooltips</h3>
<p>
  UGX WeaponsEditor++ features over 200 tooltips which attempt to aid you in
  discovering what the settings available to you are actually used for. To learn
  what any setting in the program does, hover over it (not the text label, the
  setting box itself) and read the description which appears. If you believe one
  of the tooltips is incorrect, please send a PM to
  <a
    href="https://ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=1"

  </a>
  on the forum.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-SavingyourChanges">Saving your Changes</h2>
<p>
  Once you have finished editing the weaponFile, you can either save the changes
  to the file you have open with the Save button, or you can save it as a new
  weaponFile with the Save As button. If you accidentally close UGX
  WeaponsEditor++ before saving your changes, it will warn you before closing
  the program.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-AdvancedMode">Advanced Mode</h2>
<p>
  UGX WeaponsEditor++ has an &quot;Advanced Mode&quot; which can be toggled on
  and off via the check box above the save buttons. As it's tooltip states,
  Advanced Mode allows you to edit/add any setting for the currently opened
  weapponFile, regardless of if the setting was originally in the file. This is
  mainly used to convert a weapon to a different weaponClass (for instance,
  turning a colt into a grenade launcher). Without Advanced Mode, you would not
  be able to add the needed class settings to do these conversions.
</p>
<p>
  It is also useful for adding certain settings to the weaponFile which are
  actually supported by the class, even if not originally available in the
  weaponFile. For example, you can add &quot;Fire Type&quot; to projectile
  weapons, even though the files don't have this setting in them. There are
  other settings which will work like this - try for yourself and you might be
  surprised! Don't be afraid to add settings which might not work with the
  current weaponClass - if they are not supported they will be ignored by the
  engine.
</p>
<h2 id="UGXWeaponsEditor++-ConvertingaBO1weaponFiletoCoD4/5">
  Converting a BO1 weaponFile to CoD4/5
</h2>
<p>
  If you would like to port a weapon from Black Ops 1 but don't want to waste
  time transferring all of the state timers, damage stats, ammo stats, model
  settings, etc from the BO1 weaponFile to a World at War weaponFile, you can
  use the Convert to CoD4/5 button to make a BO1 weaponFile compatible with
  CoD4/5. It removes most of the &quot;ikHandle&quot; settings and some other
  useless Black Ops-specific settings which were making the weaponFile too long
  to be parsed by the World at War engine. Be sure to use Save or Save As after
  converting your weaponFile, otherwise the changes will not be made!
