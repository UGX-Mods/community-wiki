  This program was designed to make the process of editing weapons files for the
  CoD series faster and easier. Created out of frustration, the goal of this
  program is to be more efficient and reliable than Asset Manager, and easier to
  use than a Text Editor, while providing useful features such as stat
  generation and a key search.

            After entering all or part of a KEY name (this means the LEFT column
            of the grid; you currently cannot search for values; this feature
            would be somewhat useless as most values are numbers), it will
            attempt to find an exact match for what you entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an exact match is not found, it will begin cycling though
            potetial matches for a partial key entry.

            This option will automatically generate 'PaP'd' weapon statistics
            for the currently opened weapon file based on user preference.
            Clicking this option will bring up a small window with many dropdown
            boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each dropdown box corresponds to a specific statistic of the
            currently opened weapon file, such as Fire Rate or Clip Size. Using
            the dropdown menus, you can specify degrees of intensity for the
            randomly generated values.
          </p>
          <p>
            After generation is complete, you can refer to the console to see
            (most of) the changed values. Any values you cannot see in the
            console are checkable by referring to the now changed table grid in
            the main window.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not happy with the values, you may click the 'Auto-PaP'
            button in the Auto-PaP window to generate new stats, or manually
            edit them using the grid.

                This must not be used on 'Projectile' weapon files such as the
                Panzershreck or the Grenade Launcher. To edit the stats of these
                weapons, perform a manual edit via The Grid.

<h1 id="GUIWeaponEditor-TheGrid">The Grid</h1>
<p>
  The Grid is a table displaying all key-value pairs of the currently opened
  weapon file. The left column, which contains bolded, uneditable 'Keys' are the
  names for each value (the right column). The right column, which contains
  editable 'Values', are the values of the Keys (the left column). Take care to
  maintain the data type for each column, i.e. do not replace numerical values
  with alphabetic characters, or vise versa. This will result in a weapon file
  unusable by Call of Duty.
</p>
<h1 id="GUIWeaponEditor-KvPDictionary">KvP Dictionary</h1>
<p>
  This is an abridged dictionary of some of the more obscure and commonly used
  key-value pairs in a common &quot;bulletweapon&quot; weapon file.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>alphanumeric</strong>
  : This can contain letters, spaces and/or numbers
</p>
<p>
  <strong>numeric</strong>
  : This can only contain numbers
</p>
<p>
  <strong>alphabetic</strong>
  : This can only contain letters, no spaces
</p>
