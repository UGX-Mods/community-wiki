<h2 id="BO3|Addingcustommodels-Preparingneededfiles">Preparing needed files</h2>
<p>You will need an .XMODEL_EXPORT file to start with.</p>
<h3 id="BO3|Addingcustommodels-Converting.XMODEL_EXPORTto.XMODEL_BIN">
  Converting .XMODEL_EXPORT to .XMODEL_BIN
</h3>
<p>
  BO3 has a new compiled format for xmodels called xmodel_bin. All of your
  exported xmodels must be converted to this format in order to be loaded by
  <a
    href="/Modding/Black-Ops-3-Modtools/Applications-and-Tools/Asset-Property-Editor">
    Asset Property Editor (A.P.E.)
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  In order to convert the files, you must use
  <a
    href="/Modding/Black-Ops-3-Modtools/Applications-and-Tools/export2bin_exe.html"
    target="_blank">
    export2bin.exe
  </a>
  .
</p>
<h2 id="BO3|Addingcustommodels-CreatingtheassetinA.P.E.">

</h2>
<p>
  Once you have your .XMODEL_BIN files, you are ready to set up the xmodel in
  <a
    href="/Modding/Black-Ops-3-Modtools/Applications-and-Tools/Asset-Property-Editor">
    Asset Property Editor (A.P.E.)
  </a>
  . Start by creating a new asset in your GDT of choice.
</p>
<p>
  For the Asset Name, enter a name for the xmodel you wish to use. I often
  recommend using the same name as the xmodel file although it is personal
  preference.
</p>
<p>For the Asset Type, choose &quot;xmodel&quot;. </p>
<p>Then click OK to create the xmodel asset.</p>
<h2 id="BO3|Addingcustommodels-ConfiguringtheassetoptionsinA.P.E.">
  Configuring the asset options in A.P.E.
</h2>
<p>
  Once you create your xmodel asset, you will see a confirmation screen with
  lots of options, most of which you can safely ignore.
</p>
<p>
  For &quot;Type&quot; you must select a type for the model. If this model will
  be animated, choose animated - otherwise the correct option is rigid in nearly
  all cases.
</p>
<p>
  Next you need to set the &quot;File&quot; under the &quot;LOD 0&quot;  section
  to your XMODEL_BIN file you created earlier. Once you set this, you should see
  a preview of your model in the preview window, but it will not have any
  textures.

<p>
  If you scroll down to the Materials section of your xmodel asset, you will see
  a list of all the materials the xmodel needs. The ones which are
  <strong>missing</strong>
  have a yellow exclamation icon next to them. Simply click the icon to create
  the materials you need for your xmodel. For more information on creating
  materials and textures, see
