<p>
  Thanks to the Treyarch PC development team we now have our own GSC syntax for
  Sublime Text 3! Another thing is that it is fairly easy to install.

      <strong>NOTE</strong>
      : Before reading this guide, determine where your Black Ops 3 root
      directory is located.

      <strong>Non-Steam Install</strong>
      : C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty Black Ops III\
    </p>

      <strong>Steam Install</strong>
      : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\
      <span>Call of Duty Black Ops III</span>

      For the rest of this guide, it will be assumed that the word
      &quot;root&quot; refers to the appropriate installation path shown above.

    <p>
      Say 'Yes to all' if Windows asks you about replacing files when dragging
      files into your root directory.

<p>
  The GSC package contains some useful tools to make BO3 scripting easier and
  more convenient.
</p>
<p>Some of these functions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Function suggestions</li>
</ul>

  Installing the package
</h2>
<p>
  This package is located in
  <strong>root/docs_modtools.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Here you will find a zip-file named &quot;gsc_sublime.zip&quot;. Once located
  you will want to extract the files contents into a folder called GSC / What
  ever you want. This part is not that important but the contents of that
  &quot;.zip&quot; must go into a folder. Now copy that folder you have created
  ( the folder &amp; its contents are now saved into your clipboard ).
</p>
<p>
  Next navigate to your Sublime Text 3 root directory. This can be done easily
  by launching Sublime Text 3, going to &quot;
  <em>Preferences</em>
  &quot; (Top bar) and clicking on &quot;
  <em>Browse Packages</em>
  &quot;. Your packages folder will now open. Paste your folder in there. You're
  done!
</p>
<p>
  Now you can restart Sublime Text (if it was still open) and in the bottom
  right you should be able to select GSC from the list!
