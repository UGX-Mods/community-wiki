<p>
  In the current version of the BO3 Modtools (Beta), dog spawners are missing
  from the test map but are not disabled in the scripts by default. This causes
  you to get stuck on an infinite dog round when you play your map. You can fix
  this by adding dog spawners or disabling dogs in your map file. Treyarch also
  did not include a dog spawner prefab with the tools at this time, so you would
  normally have to grab stuff from The Giant mapfile.

<p>Add this line to your usermap.gsc file, before zm_usermap::main();:</p>
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px">
  <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">

  Installing the Spawner Prefab
</h2>
<p>
  Download the prefab: 
  <a 
    href="attachments/17301594/17301592.map"
    data-linked-resource-id="17301592"
    data-linked-resource-version="1"
    data-linked-resource-type="attachment"
    data-linked-resource-default-alias="dog_spawner.map"
    data-nice-type="Text File"
    data-linked-resource-content-type="text/plain"
    data-linked-resource-container-id="17301594"
    data-linked-resource-container-version="6">
    dog_spawner.map
  </a>
  and place it anywhere within your _prefabs folder, which can be found at 
  <strong>Call of Duty Black Ops III\map_source\_prefabs</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="BO3|AddingDogSpawnersorDisablingDogRounds-PlacingthePrefab">
  Placing the Prefab
</h2>
<p>
  From the Entity Browser, drag a Misc\_prefab into your scene and navigate to
  the dog_spawner.map prefab in the file browser window. 
</p>
<p>
  Next, with the prefab still selected, stamp the prefab into your map using the
  Stamp menu item:
</p>
<p>
  <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper">
    <img 
      class="confluence-embedded-image"
      draggable="false"
      src="attachments/17301594/17301593.png"
      data-image-src="attachments/17301594/17301593.png"
      data-unresolved-comment-count="0"
      data-linked-resource-id="17301593"
      data-linked-resource-version="1"
      data-linked-resource-type="attachment"
      data-linked-resource-default-alias="ef27d37e6e7068c21b862951d8888d20.png"
      data-base-url="https://confluence.ugx-mods.com"
      data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png"
      data-linked-resource-container-id="17301594"
      data-linked-resource-container-version="6"
      alt="" >
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Once you stamp the prefab, it will separate the dog spawner from the spawner
  struct. Move the dog spawner (looks like a hellhound model) somewhere under
  your map or to a hidden location of your choice. It doesn't matter where it
  is, just hide it.
</p>
<h2 id="BO3|AddingDogSpawnersorDisablingDogRounds-ConfiguringtheSpawnPoints">
  Configuring the Spawn Points
</h2>
<p>
  Select the struct that you got from stamping the prefab earlier. Notice it has
  a targetname &quot;start_zone_spawners&quot; - you need to change this to
  match whatever zone you are setting this spawner for. If you are configuring
  the spawner for your start zone then just leave this KVP alone.
</p>
<p>
  You can copy and paste this struct all over your map to create more spawn
  points, taking care to change the targetname when you paste it within a new
  zone volume.
