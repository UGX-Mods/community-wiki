<p>
  Timed Gameplay is possible in BO3 by overriding specific functions running in
  _zm.gsc. This is necessary because _zm.gsc is not directly editable at this
  time (Modtools Beta).
</p>
<p>
  If you are already overriding any of the functions used in this script, simply
  take that code out of the file and add it to your existing override function.
</p>
<p>
  Currently this is an adapted script from the upcoming version of UGX Mod for
  BO3. The script will be improved over time after some feedback.

  (version 1.0) and place it in
  <strong>root/usermaps/mapname/scripts/zm</strong>
</p>
<p>Add this line to the top of your mapname.gsc:</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#using scripts\zm\ugxmods_timedgp;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Add this line to your mapname.zone:</p>

<h2 id="BO3|AddingTimedGameplaytoZombiemode-Usage">Usage</h2>
<p>
  You should see a timer in the lower left corner of the screen now and zombies
  should continuously spawn without delay for the entire game. Currently we have
  not found a way to hide the round counter yet but we are working on it.
