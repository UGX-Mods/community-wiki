<p>
  Call of Duty Black ops 3 has brought along a completely new Weapon System. The
  new Weapon System contains a lot of nicer and feature rich functions. We have
  documented as much as we currently know about the functions and functionality
  of said functions. The following links will guide you through working with the
  new Weapon System.
