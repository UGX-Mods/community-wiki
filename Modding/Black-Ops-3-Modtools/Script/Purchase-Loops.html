  It is suggested that if you are familiar with World at War scripting and/or
  Black Ops scripting, that you check out the

    BO3 | What's changed from WaW scripting?
  </a>
</p>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This tutorial will show the steps to setting up a Custom Script to include a
  &quot;Purchase Loop&quot; which can be implemented to allow traps, wallbuys,
  and other custom scripts to have a way of purchasing the feature.
</p>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-Including_zm_score.gsc">Including _zm_score.gsc</h2>
<p>
  The _zm_score.gsc contains the function minus_to_player_score, which will
  allow the user to remove points from a given player as well as display the
  change of points on the HUD.
</p>
<p>
  Since this script is not a part of your specific script, your must include the
  using line for this file so the script as access to minus_to_player_score.
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#using scripts\zm\_zm_score; // Add this line at the top of your script</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-Trigger">Trigger</h2>
<p>
  To check if the player is press the use key on a trigger, you will have to
  create a trigger_use in radiant and give it a kvp of targetname with your own
  name for the value (this tutorial named the trigger &quot;test_trigger&quot;).
</p>
<p>
  The script will get the trigger using the GetEnt function as well as use the
  waittill function to wait until the trigger has been activated. Notice how
  there is a variable in the waittill function named player;
</p>
<p>
  the player variable here is being defined as the entity that activated the
  trigger. This is important, since it can be used to minus the score from the
  player later.
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
function testfunction(parameter)
{
	trigger = GetEnt(&quot;test_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);
	trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);
}</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-IfStatement">If Statement</h2>
<p>
  Checking if the player has enough points to actually purchase the feature
  requires an If Statement. This will allow the script to compare the integer
  value of the player's score to the cost of the feature.
</p>
<p>
  This cost has to be set before hand as its own variable. As for the player's
  score, it is defined as a variable on the player - player.score
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
function testfunction(parameter)
{
	trigger = GetEnt(&quot;test_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);
	cost = 1000;

	trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);

	if(player.score &gt;= cost) // checking if the player&#39;s score is greater than or equal to the cost
	{
		// Code to perform if the player has enough points
	}
}</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-WhileLoops">While Loops</h2>
<p>
  The script will require 2 While Loops to achieve the logic for the Purchase
  Loop. The first While Loop is to allow the script to perform your code
  multiple times such as a Trap or purchasing an Item more than once.
</p>
<p>
  The second While Loop is inset into the first one to allow it to be used
  multiple times. This second While Loop will loop until the player has enough
  points to activate the trigger.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0)">
    Note: while loops require a form of &quot;waiting&quot; so that it doesn't
    loop multiple times on the same frame. This can be in the form of a waittill
    or wait function.
  </span>
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
function testfunction(parameter)
{
	trigger = GetEnt(&quot;test_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);
	cost = 1000;
	coolDownTime = 30; // time in seconds before the trigger can be activated again

	while(1)
	{
		while(1)
		{
			// Purchase Code
			trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);

			if(player.score &gt;= cost)
			{
				// Code
			}
		}

		// Your Code
		wait(coolDownTime);
	}
}</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-PurchaseCode">Purchase Code</h2>
<p>
  The final step is to allow the inset While Loop to break (meaning it will
  allow the code to continue outside of the loop) so if the player does have
  enough points it will perform the rest of the code.
</p>
<p>
  Using the player variable you can now call the function from _zm_score.gsc to
  minus the points from the player. Also adding the break keyword to the if
  statement will allow for the code to break out of the most immediate loop and
  continue the code below.
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
function testfunction(parameter)
{
	trigger = GetEnt(&quot;test_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);
	cost = 1000;
	coolDownTime = 30;

	while(1)
	{
		while(1)
		{
			// Purchase Code
			trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);

			if(player.score &gt;= cost)
			{
				player zm_score::minus_to_player_score(cost);
					break;
			}
		}

		// Your Code
		wait(coolDownTime);
	}
}</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="BO3|PurchaseLoops-Sounds">Sounds</h2>
<p>
  An extra step would be to include sounds for the purchase loop. When the
  player purchases the feature using a sounds like a &quot;cha-ching&quot; will
  solidify the purchase, as well as doing a deny sound for when they don't have
  enough points.
</p>
<p>
  These sounds are played on the trigger, but can also be played on the player.
  Note the names &quot;name_of_purchase_sound&quot; and
  &quot;name_of_deny_sound&quot; are just made up alias names. If you want to
  include your own sounds or know some in game aliases then you can include
  those.
</p>
<div class="widget-panel widget-code-panel">
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">
function testfunction(parameter)
{
	trigger = GetEnt(&quot;test_trigger&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);
	cost = 1000;
	coolDownTime = 30;

	while(1)
	{
		while(1)
		{
			// Purchase Code
			trigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);

			if(player.score &gt;= cost)
			{
				player zm_score::minus_to_player_score(cost);
				trigger playsound(&quot;name_of_purchase_sound&quot;);
				break;
			}
			else
			{
				trigger playsound(&quot;name_of_deny_sound&quot;);
			}
		}

		// Your Code
		wait(coolDownTime);
	}
}</code></pre>
</div>
