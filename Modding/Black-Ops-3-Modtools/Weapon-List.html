<p>
  To view a list of all enumerated weapons that are loaded into the game we can
  use the console to help us.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the game.</li>
  <li>Load the map and/or mod.</li>
  <li>
    Open the console and type this command to show all channels for the console:
    /con_channelshow *;logfile 1 (exactly like this as ; is a separate for the
    console to parse the next block as a new input for the console)
  </li>
  <li>Next type /listassetpool 23</li>
  <li>Let the game process all the assets then we can exit the game.</li>
  <li>
    Go to your Black Ops III root folder and find the map and/or mod we were in
    and locate the console_mp.log.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon opening the log you'll see the output of all the weapon assets that are
    loaded b the game. Note: Â All of non-gamemode weapons will not work i.e.
    trying to give yourself ar_marksman_cp you need to one that's loaded for
    your gamemode specifically.
  </li>
</ol>
