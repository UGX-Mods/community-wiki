  Soundaliases are created for connecting sound to your map/mod. With
  soundalias, you can define how loud sound is, what range it's going to be
  played at, is it 2D/3D and so on.
</p>
<p><strong>Converting soundfile</strong></p>
<p>
  First, make your soundfile .wav format so programs like Audacity can read it.
</p>
<p>Drop soundfile in Audacity. Check that Hz is 48000:</p>
<p>

      draggable="false"

      data-image-src="https://i.gyazo.com/a1b0b2724d3d11859347e759303ca260.png" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Then select Export Audio at top left drop down menu. Make sure you select
  Other Packaged Files and Signed 16-bit PCM. Then just export it as .wav, your
  file should be ready for Black Ops 3.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Adding soundalias in your mod</strong></p>
<p>
  Now that you have sound ready, let's take a look how to include the sound.
</p>
<p>There are few ways to include the sound, I will explain few of them.</p>
<p>
  <u><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">Longer, more reliable way</span></u>
</p>
<p>
  Go to root / share / raw / sound / aliases /. In this folder, you will
  find user_aliases.csv. Copy this in same folder and name it to your maps/mods
  .ff file.
</p>
<p><em>ZM Mod uses zm_mod.ff, so file should be named zm_mod.csv</em></p>
<p><em>MP Mod uses mp_mod.ff, so file should be named mp_mod.csv</em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    Maps .ff is your mapname, so name file either zm_mapname.csv or
    mp_mapname.csv, depending on gamemode.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em><br /></em>
</p>
<p>Now that you have the file done, let's quickly add it in zonefile.</p>
<p>
  Open Launcher, right click your map/mod and do Edit Zone File. Here, add in
  new line:
</p>
<p>
  sound,csv_file_name without .csv at end. Now you have soundalias included in
  your mod.
</p>
<p><u>Easiest way, but not the best option</u></p>
<p>
  If you fail the step before, then just edit user_aliases.csv, it will be
  automatically included in your map,
</p>
<p>
  But beware, this soundalias gets overwritten with every update/verify
  integrity on cache, so keep backup of this file in case it gets overwritten
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  For easier access to soundalias and modifying keys/values, we recommend
  installing UGX Alias Editor
</p>
<p>
  Note though, it is meant for World at War and is in Beta. It doesn't show
  keys/values info in BO3 soundaliases, but it works fine for quick jobs.
