    The Visual C++ Redistributable Packages install run-time components that are
    required to run applications that are developed by using Visual Studio 2013,
    on computers that don't have Visual Studio 2013 installed.
    <br />
    These packages install run-time components of these libraries: C Runtime
    (CRT), Standard C++, ATL, MFC, C++ AMP, and OpenMP.
