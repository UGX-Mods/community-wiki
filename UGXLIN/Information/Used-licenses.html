Licensee should not install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

Upon Licensee’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, The Qt Company grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed 
Software in the manner provided below.


5. LICENSES GRANTED

5.1 General

5.1.1 Licensee is hereby granted a free of charge license for the 
Start-For-Free Term as described in Section 5.2 below. For clarity, 
Section 5.3 shall not apply for the Start-For-Free Term.

5.1.2 Licensee may purchase additional license(s) for Continued-Usage
 Term, as described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below, subject to The Qt 
Company’s payment terms and conditions applicable at the time of 
purchase. In addition, Licensee may purchase license(s) for the 
Continued-Usage Term without such a preceding Start-For-Free Term.

5.2 Licenses granted during the Start-For-Free Term and the Continued-Usage Term

5.2.1 Using, Modifying and Copying

The Qt Company grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
limited term license to use, modify and copy the Licensed Software for 
Designated Users specified in the License Certificate for the sole 
purposes of:

(i) designing, developing, and testing Application(s);

(ii) modifying the Licensed Software as limited by section 8 below; and

(iii) compiling the Licensed Software and/or Modified Software source code into object code.

Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited 
number of computers provided that only the Designated Users use the 
Licensed Software.

Licensee may at any time during the Supported Term designate another 
Designated User to replace a then-current Designated User by notifying 
The Qt Company, provided that a) the then-current Designated User has 
not been designated as a replacement during the last six (6) months; and
 b) there is no more than the specified number of Designated Users at 
any given time.

5.3 Limited Redistribution right for the Continued-Usage Term only

The limited distribution licenses granted in this Section 5.3 shall 
only be applicable to the Continued-Usage Term, but not to 
Start-For-Free Term.

a) The Qt Company grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right
 to reproduce and distribute the object code form of Redistributables 
(listed in Appendix 1, Section 1) for execution on the specified 
Deployment Platforms, excluding the Joint Hardware and Software 
Distribution as defined in b) below. Copies of Redistributables may only
 be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications 
permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the 
Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of 
Redistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not give
 Licensee any rights to distribute any of the parts of the Licensed 
Software listed in Appendix 1, Section 2, neither as a whole nor as 
parts or snippets of code.

b) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose
 of Applications and/or Redistributables, in binary/compiled form, or in
 any other form, if such action is part of a Joint Software and Hardware
 Distribution, except as provided by a separate runtime distribution 
license with The Qt Company or one of its authorized distributors. A 
Joint Hardware and Software Distribution shall be defined as either:

(i) distribution of a hardware device where, in its final end user 
configuration, the main user interface of the device is provided by 
Application(s) created by Licensee or others, using Licensed Software or
 Licensed Software based software product, and depends on the Licensed 
Software or an open source version of Qt or any Qt based software 
product; or

(ii) distribution of the Licensed Software with a device designed to 
facilitate the installation of the Licensed Software onto the same 
device where the main user interface of such device is provided by 
Application(s) created by Licensee or others, using the Licensed 
Software, and depends on the Licensed Software.

c) For the avoidance of doubt, should the Licensee wish to distribute
 Licensed Software as a part of software development kit (SDK) for the 
purpose of developing Applications by Licensee´s customers for 
Licensee´s products, such distribution is subject to a separate Qt SDK 
distribution license agreement to be concluded with The Qt Company.

The licenses granted in this Section 5 by The Qt Company to Licensee 
are subject to Licensee’s compliance with Section 8 of this Agreement.


6. VERIFICATION

The Qt Company or a certified auditor on The Qt Company’s behalf, 
may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit Licensee with
 respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such audit may be 
conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to 
Licensee’s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be 
conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and 
shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. 
The Qt Company will not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic 
material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that 
Licensee is using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material 
violation of the terms of the Agreement, then Licensee shall pay The Qt 
Company’s reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a 
material violation, Licensee agrees to pay The Qt Company any amounts 
owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. Alternatively, The 
Qt Company reserves the right, at The Qt Company’s sole option, to 
terminate the licenses for the Licensed Software.


7. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or 
code (collectively “Third Party Software”) to implement various 
functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed 
Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included 
along with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for 
development and testing only. Such source code and libraries may be 
listed in the “…/src/3rdparty” source tree delivered with the Licensed 
Software or documented in the Licensed Software where the Third Party 
Software is used, as may be amended from time to time, do not comprise 
the Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges (i) that some part of Third
 Party Software may require additional licensing of copyright and 
patents from the owners of such, and (ii) that distribution of any of 
the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Software 
may require appropriate licensing from such third parties.


8. CONDITIONS FOR CREATING APPLICATIONS

The licenses granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create, modify
 and distribute Applications is subject to all of the following 
conditions: (i) all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must 
bear a valid copyright notice either Licensee’s own or the copyright

remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights 
notice contained in any portion of the Licensed Software including but 
not limited to the About Boxes; (iii) Licensee will indemnify and hold 
The Qt Company, its Affiliates, contractors, and its suppliers, harmless
 from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of the use, 
reproduction or distribution of Applications; (iv) Applications must be 
developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software; 
(v) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the 
Licensed Software; (vi) Applications may not pass on functionality which
 in any way makes it possible for others to create software with the 
Licensed Software; however Licensee may use the Licensed Software’s 
scripting and QML (“Qt Quick”) functionality solely in order to enable 
scripting, themes and styles that augment the functionality and 
appearance of the Application(s) without adding primary and substantial 
functionality to the Application(s); (vii) Licensee may create Modified 
Software that breaks the source or binary compatibility with the 
Licensed Software. This includes, but is not limited to, changing the 
application programming interfaces (“API”) by adding, changing or 
deleting any variable, method, or class signature in the Licensed 
Software, the inter-process QCop specification, and/or any inter-process
 protocols, services or standards in the Licensed Software libraries. To
 the extent that Licensee breaks source or binary compatibility with the
 Licensed Software, Licensee acknowledges that The Qt Company’s ability 
to provide Support may be prevented or limited and Licensee’s ability to
 make use of Updates may be restricted; (viii) Applications may not 
compete with the Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use The Qt 
Company’s or any of its suppliers’ names, logos, or trademarks to market
 Applications, except to state that Licensee’s Application(s) was 
developed using the Licensed Software; and (x) each Designated User 
creating the Application(s) needs to have a separate license for the 
Licensed Software.

NOTE: If Licensee, or another third party, has, at any time, 
developed or distributed all (or any portions of) the Application(s) 
using an open source version of Qt licensed under the terms of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later (“LGPL”) or the GNU 
General Public License version 2.0 or later (“GPL”), Licensee may 
contact The Qt Company via email to address sales@qt.io to ask for the 
necessary permission to combine such development work with the Licensed 
Software. The Qt Company shall evaluate Licensee´s request, and respond 
to the request with estimated license costs and other applicable terms 
and details relating to the permission for the Licensee, depending on 
the actual situation in question. Copies of the licenses referred to 
above are located at

9. PRE-RELEASE CODE

The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality 
marked or otherwise stated as “Technology Preview”, “Alpha”, “Beta” or 
similar. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide 
experimental support for new platforms or preliminary version of new 
functionality. The pre-release code is not at the level of performance 
and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering. The
 pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly 
and may be substantially modified prior to the first commercial product 
release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make 
pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or 
Updates relating thereto.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, The Qt Company on 
behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all warranties and 
conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, 
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular 
purpose, title and non-infringement regarding to the Licensed Software.


11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

If, The Qt Company’s warranty disclaimer notwithstanding, The Qt 
Company is held to be liable to Licensee whether in contract, tort, or 
any other legal theory, based on the Licensed Software, The Qt Company’s
 entire liability to Licensee and Licensee’s exclusive remedy shall be, 
at The Qt Company’s option, either (a) return of the price Licensee paid
 for the Licensed Software, or (b) repair or replacement of the Licensed
 Software, provided Licensee returns all copies of the Licensed Software
 to The Qt Company as originally delivered to Licensee. The Qt Company 
shall not under any circumstances be liable to Licensee based on failure
 of the Licensed Software if the failure resulted from accident, abuse 
or misapplication, nor shall The Qt Company, under any circumstances, be
 liable for special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for 
loss of profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of
 data. Any award of damages from The Qt Company to Licensee shall not 
exceed the total amount Licensee has paid to The Qt Company in 
connection with this Agreement.


12. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES

Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use 
the Online Services during the Supported Term, in accordance with The Qt
 Company’s then current policies and procedures, if any. Such policies 
and procedures may be changed from time to time. For clarity, under the 
Limited Subscription License, the Licensee shall not be eligible to 
receive any Support for the Licensed Software.

As for the Perpetual License, unless Licensee notifies The Qt Company
 in writing no less than thirty (30) days prior to each expiry of 
Supported Term, Supported Term may, at the Qt Company’s option be 
extended by Renewal Term, subject to due payments by Licensee and 
subject to The Qt Company’s terms and conditions applicable at the time 
of extension.

In the event Licensee selects not to have Supported Term extended, 
The Qt Company shall, following the expiry of Supported Term, no longer 
make the Licensed Software, Support, Updates or Online Services 
available to Licensee.


13. CONFIDENTIALITY

Each party acknowledges that during the Start-For-Free-Term and 
Supported Term of this Agreement it shall have access to information 
about the other party’s business, business methods, business plans, 
customers, business relations, technology, and other information, 
including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great
 value to the other party, and the value of which would be significantly
 reduced if disclosed to third parties (“Confidential Information”). 
Accordingly, when a party (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential 
Information from another party (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving 
Party shall, and shall obligate its employees and agents and employees 
and agents of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain the Confidential 
Information in strict confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential 
Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party’s prior 
written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the 
Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its 
rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. 
Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential 
Information of the other party, which measures shall not be less than 
the measures taken by such party to protect its own confidential and 
proprietary information.

“Confidential Information” shall not include information that (a) is 
or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of 
the Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession 
prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on 
disclosure or use; (c) is developed by employees of the Receiving Party 
or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access
 to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by 
the written records of the Receiving Party or by persons who have not 
had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as 
proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (d) is lawfully 
disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party 
not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party 
is legally compelled to disclose the information, in which case the 
Receiving Party shall assert the privileged and confidential nature of 
the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to protect
 against and prevent disclosure of any Confidential Information and to 
limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed 
Confidential Information by all legally available means.

The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue
 during the Supported Term and for a period of five (5) years after 
expiration or termination of this Agreement. To the extent that the 
terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between The Qt Company and 
Licensee conflict with the terms of this Section 13, this Section 13 
shall be controlling over the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.


14. GENERAL PROVISIONS

14.1 No Assignment

Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its 
rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior 
written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably 
withheld. The Qt Company shall be entitled to assign or transfer any of 
its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement on an 
unrestricted basis.

14.2 Termination

The Qt Company may terminate the Agreement at any time immediately upon 
written notice by The Qt Company to Licensee if Licensee breaches this 
Agreement.

Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement 
immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party 
becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any 
assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative 
receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of 
its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of 
the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other party.

Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall cease using the 
Licensed Software and return to The Qt Company all copies of Licensed 
Software that were supplied by The Qt Company. All other copies of 
Licensed Software in the possession or control of Licensee must be 
erased or destroyed. An officer of Licensee must promptly deliver to The
 Qt Company a written confirmation that this has occurred.

14.3 Surviving Sections

Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably 
should survive a cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall 
also be deemed to survive. Such surviving terms and conditions include, 
but are not limited to the Section 13.

14.4 Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the parties 
and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, 
representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the 
subject matters discussed herein, with the exception of the 
non-disclosure agreement executed by the parties in connection with this
 Agreement (“Non-Disclosure Agreement”), if any, shall be subject to 
Section 13. No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless 
contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each 
party. No term or condition contained in Licensee’s purchase order shall
 apply unless expressly accepted by The Qt Company in writing. If any 
provision of the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder
 shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any 
remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, 
all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
 Agreement shall remain in effect.

14.5 Payment and Taxes

If credit has been extended to Licensee by The Qt Company, all payments 
under this Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date The Qt 
Company mails its invoice to Licensee. If The Qt Company has not 
extended credit to Licensee, Licensee shall be required to make payment 
concurrent with the delivery of the Licensed Software by The Qt Company.
 All amounts payable are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added 
tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax. Licensee shall be entitled to 
withhold from payments any applicable withholding taxes and comply with 
all applicable tax and employment legislation. Each party shall pay all 
taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or 
levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties
 as a result of this Agreement and any payments made hereunder 
(including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments). 
Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to
 enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including
 original withholding tax certificates.

As for the Limited Subscription License, the fees under this 
Agreement applicable for the Licensee, as further stated in www.qt.io, 
are subject to Licensee´s annual sales revenue being smaller than one 
hundred thousand (&lt;100,000) USD. In case the Licensee´s annual sales 
revenue would increase up to one hundred thousand (100,000) USD or more,
 (i) the Licensee shall inform The Qt Company without undue delay in 
written form of such increase, and (ii) The Qt Company shall reserve the
 right to change applicable pricing for The Licensee, depending on The 
Qt Company´s then current pricing, as further stated in www.qt.io. The 
Licensee shall have the obligation, upon reasonable prior request by The
 Qt Company, to prove that its annual sales revenue is smaller than one 
hundred thousand (&lt;100,000) USD in order for the Licensee to be 
entitled to continue using the Limited Subscription License.

14.6 Force Majeure

Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or 
non-performance of its obligations hereunder other than the obligation 
of paying the license fees in the event and to the extent that such 
delay or non-performance is due to an event of Force Majeure (as defined
 below). If any event of Force Majeure results in a delay or 
non-performance of a party for a period of three (3) months or longer, 
then either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with 
immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of 
payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other 
party. A “Force Majeure” event shall mean an act of God, terrorist 
attack or other catastrophic event of nature that prevents either party 
for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.

14.7 Notices

Any notice given by one party to the other shall be deemed properly 
given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving 
party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by 
hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business
 day to the addresses specified below. Each communication and document 
made or delivered by one party to the other party pursuant to this 
Agreement shall be in the English language or accompanied by a 
translation thereof.

export control restrictions of various countries. Licensee shall fully 
comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements 
as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the importation of 
the Licensed Software and/or Modified Software and/or Applications and 
shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including 
without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or 
consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Licensed 
Software, Modified Software or Applications.

need-to-know basis for such Personal Data to be able to provide its 
services to The Qt Company, or (2) in order to comply with the law or 
requests of governmental entities. Given the global nature of The Qt 
Company´s business, processing information for such purposes may involve
 a cross-border transfer of Personal Data. In addition, The Qt Company 
may collect individual user´s IP address and browser cookies about the 
use of services or tools relating to Licensed Software, and visits to 
The Qt Company´s web pages.

In processing and transferring Personal Data The Qt Company shall 
comply with all applicable European or foreign data protection laws as 
effective from time to time.

14.10 Governing Law and Legal Venue

 laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions. Any disputes, 
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or 
the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be shall be finally

award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Helsinki, 
Finland and the process shall be conducted in the English language.

14.11 No Implied License

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this
 Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder,

Introduction
============

  This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
  Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
  applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
  under their own explicit license.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We  don&#39;t promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      Catharon Code. (`credits&#39;)

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
  Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
  their use.

  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and may provide additional or different license
terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.


5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.

            IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements
            Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical
            accessibility API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was
            created out of necessity to produce a usable and accessible
            OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of
            Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface
            allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA
            while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich
            document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors
            and web browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality
            includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0
            applications, and other large mainstream applications.

            GBK is an extension of the GB2312 character set for simplified
            Chinese characters, used in the People's Republic of China. GB is
            the abbreviation of Guojia Biaozhun (国家标准), which means national
            standard in Chinese, while K stands for Extension
            (&quot;Kuozhan&quot;). GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312
            with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese
            characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in
            1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters
            formerly unrepresentable, like the &quot;rong&quot; (镕) character
            in former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.

            featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than
            lucene as it is written in C++.

          -- quoted from

        </p>
        <p>
          The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source
          code. These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
          and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license
          they wish to distribute their software under. This means that you do
          not need to abide by *both* licenses, but rather than you can choose
          the license which most suits your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is
          distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or*
          the Apache License, Version 2.0
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use
          the LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community.
          Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free
          access to the technology both for the GPL community and for other
          developers or companies that cannot use the GPL.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code.
          The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code
          and contribute modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache
          licenses allow different ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in
          the end, regardless of the license used, we highly recommend that you
          submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene
          Contributions package. You should read the COPYING file in that
          directory or package for more information.

  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
