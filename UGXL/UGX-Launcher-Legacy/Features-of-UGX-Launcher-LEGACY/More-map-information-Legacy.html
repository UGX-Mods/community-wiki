<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection with UGX Play offers many new information for each map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Beside the general information like map creator(s), release date and current
  version there is also media ( Screenshots and videos ),
</p>
<p>
  map reviews with score, community vote, map features, map description and map
  changelog.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Later once UGX GameStats is released it will also show the map specific UGX
  Leaderboards and UGX Lobby information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information on UGX PLay are also accessible through the web browser.</p>
