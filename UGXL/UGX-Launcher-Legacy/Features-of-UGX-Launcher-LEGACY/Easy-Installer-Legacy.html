<p>
  The
  <a href="/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a>
  is more than just an *.exe like the
  <a href="10420785.html">UGX MapManager</a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  Therefore the
  <a href="/UGXLIN">UGXL Installer</a>
  was created to simplify the installation process for novice users.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  It acts like a typical installer. (with custom user interface and better
  usability)
