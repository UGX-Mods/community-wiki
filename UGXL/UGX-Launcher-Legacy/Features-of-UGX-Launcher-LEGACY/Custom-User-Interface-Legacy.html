  One of the first things you will notice is the new 
  <a
    href="/UGXL/UGX-Launcher-Legacy/Features-of-UGX-Launcher-LEGACY/Custom-User-Interface-Legacy.html">
    Custom User Interface
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  And the best thing is: If you don't like it you can
  <a href="/UGXL/Community-Contributions/How-to-create-a-custom-Theme.html">
    Create a custom theme
  </a>
  and submit it to the Community. ❤️
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  This is a long process to convert and design all elements into custom ones.
</p>
<p>
  Users will notice in the first few versions some issues like slow repainting,
  flickering or other glitches.
</p>
<p>
  Over the time this will be improved and optimized for the best visual
  experience.
