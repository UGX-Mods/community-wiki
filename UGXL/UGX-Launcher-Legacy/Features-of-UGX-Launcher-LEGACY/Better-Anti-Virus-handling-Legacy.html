<p>
  The
  <a href="/UGXL/Information/UGX-MapManager-Legacy.html">UGX MapManager</a>
  had issues with Anti-Virus and Firewall applications.
</p>
<p>
  With the
  <a href="/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a>
  we try that the majority of these applications won't block it,
</p>
<p>or give detailed instructions on how to fix it.</p>
