  The
  <a href="/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a>
  will require Authentication with your
  <a href="http://www.ugx-mods.com">www.ugx-mods.com</a>
  (forum) account.
</p>
<p>We decided this for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent download spam.</li>
  <li>More features for the user</li>
  <li>Better control &amp; moderating</li>
  <li>
    Access control based on the user
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The authentication over the internet will be transmitted over an encrypted
  connection.

<p>
  Everyone can access the UGX Launcher, as long as he isn't banned / blocked
  from
  <a href="http://www.ugx-mods.com">www.ugx-mods.com</a>
