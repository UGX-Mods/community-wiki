  Please, read these license terms through carefully. By selecting “I
  accept the Agreement”, you are deemed to accept these license terms and
  to commit yourself to observing them. When representing a legal entity,
  you should ensure your due authorization to approve these terms before
  you select “I accept the Agreement”. Otherwise, we regard you as
  personally responsible for compliance with this Agreement. For clarity,
  please note that in case there already exists a signed license agreement
   between you and The Qt Company, this Agreement shall not override such
  an existing agreement but it shall continue to be valid subject to its
  applicable terms.

  Under this Agreement, the Licensee has purchased one (1) of the three
   (3) different below mentioned rights applicable to the Licensed

  international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property
   laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold.

  To the extent Licensee submits bug fixes or error corrections, including
   information related thereto, Licensee hereby grants The Qt Company a
  sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  royalty-free and fully paid-up copyright and trade secret license to
  reproduce, adapt, translate, modify, and prepare derivative works of,
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, make available and

  modules. These files contain specific notices defining the module of
  which they are a part. The modules licensed to Licensee are specified in
   the License Certificate accompanying the Licensed Software. The terms
  of the License Certificate are considered part of the Agreement. In the
  event of inconsistency or conflict between the language of this
  Agreement and the License Certificate, the provisions of this Agreement
  shall govern.


  4. VALIDITY OF THE AGREEMENT

  By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
  Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee
  does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee should not
  install, copy, or otherwise use the Licensed Software. In addition, by
  installing, copying, or otherwise using any Updates or other components
  of the Licensed Software that Licensee receives separately as part of
  the Licensed Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional
  license terms that accompany such Updates, if any. If Licensee does not
  agree to the additional license terms that accompany such Updates,
  Licensee should not install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

  Upon Licensee’s acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
  Agreement, The Qt Company grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
  Software in the manner provided below.


  5. LICENSES GRANTED

  5.1 General

  5.1.1 Licensee is hereby granted a free of charge license for the
  Start-For-Free Term as described in Section 5.2 below. For clarity,
  Section 5.3 shall not apply for the Start-For-Free Term.

  5.1.2 Licensee may purchase additional license(s) for Continued-Usage
   Term, as described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below, subject to The Qt
  Company’s payment terms and conditions applicable at the time of
  purchase. In addition, Licensee may purchase license(s) for the
  Continued-Usage Term without such a preceding Start-For-Free Term.

  5.2 Licenses granted during the Start-For-Free Term and the Continued-Usage Term

  5.2.1 Using, Modifying and Copying

  The Qt Company grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
  limited term license to use, modify and copy the Licensed Software for
  Designated Users specified in the License Certificate for the sole
  purposes of:

  (i) designing, developing, and testing Application(s);

  (ii) modifying the Licensed Software as limited by section 8 below; and

  (iii) compiling the Licensed Software and/or Modified Software source code into object code.

  Licensee may install copies of the Licensed Software on an unlimited
  number of computers provided that only the Designated Users use the
  Licensed Software.

  Licensee may at any time during the Supported Term designate another
  Designated User to replace a then-current Designated User by notifying
  The Qt Company, provided that a) the then-current Designated User has
  not been designated as a replacement during the last six (6) months; and
   b) there is no more than the specified number of Designated Users at
  any given time.

  5.3 Limited Redistribution right for the Continued-Usage Term only

  The limited distribution licenses granted in this Section 5.3 shall
  only be applicable to the Continued-Usage Term, but not to
  Start-For-Free Term.

  a) The Qt Company grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free right
   to reproduce and distribute the object code form of Redistributables
  (listed in Appendix 1, Section 1) for execution on the specified
  Deployment Platforms, excluding the Joint Hardware and Software
  Distribution as defined in b) below. Copies of Redistributables may only
   be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications
  permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the
  Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of
  Redistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not give
   Licensee any rights to distribute any of the parts of the Licensed
  Software listed in Appendix 1, Section 2, neither as a whole nor as
  parts or snippets of code.

  b) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose
   of Applications and/or Redistributables, in binary/compiled form, or in
   any other form, if such action is part of a Joint Software and Hardware
   Distribution, except as provided by a separate runtime distribution
  license with The Qt Company or one of its authorized distributors. A
  Joint Hardware and Software Distribution shall be defined as either:

  (i) distribution of a hardware device where, in its final end user
  configuration, the main user interface of the device is provided by
  Application(s) created by Licensee or others, using Licensed Software or
   Licensed Software based software product, and depends on the Licensed
  Software or an open source version of Qt or any Qt based software
  product; or

  (ii) distribution of the Licensed Software with a device designed to
  facilitate the installation of the Licensed Software onto the same
  device where the main user interface of such device is provided by
  Application(s) created by Licensee or others, using the Licensed
  Software, and depends on the Licensed Software.

  c) For the avoidance of doubt, should the Licensee wish to distribute
   Licensed Software as a part of software development kit (SDK) for the
  purpose of developing Applications by Licensee´s customers for
  Licensee´s products, such distribution is subject to a separate Qt SDK
  distribution license agreement to be concluded with The Qt Company.

  The licenses granted in this Section 5 by The Qt Company to Licensee
  are subject to Licensee’s compliance with Section 8 of this Agreement.


  6. VERIFICATION

  The Qt Company or a certified auditor on The Qt Company’s behalf,
  may, upon its reasonable request and at its expense, audit Licensee with
   respect to the use of the Licensed Software. Such audit may be
  conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to
  Licensee’s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be
  conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and
  shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities.
  The Qt Company will not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic
  material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that
  Licensee is using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material
  violation of the terms of the Agreement, then Licensee shall pay The Qt
  Company’s reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a
  material violation, Licensee agrees to pay The Qt Company any amounts
  owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. Alternatively, The
  Qt Company reserves the right, at The Qt Company’s sole option, to
  terminate the licenses for the Licensed Software.


  7. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

  The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or
  code (collectively “Third Party Software”) to implement various
  functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed
  Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included
  along with the Licensed Software delivery as a convenience for
  development and testing only. Such source code and libraries may be
  listed in the “…/src/3rdparty” source tree delivered with the Licensed
  Software or documented in the Licensed Software where the Third Party
  Software is used, as may be amended from time to time, do not comprise
  the Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges (i) that some part of Third
   Party Software may require additional licensing of copyright and
  patents from the owners of such, and (ii) that distribution of any of
  the Licensed Software referencing any portion of a Third Party Software
  may require appropriate licensing from such third parties.


  8. CONDITIONS FOR CREATING APPLICATIONS

  The licenses granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create, modify
   and distribute Applications is subject to all of the following
  conditions: (i) all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must
  bear a valid copyright notice either Licensee’s own or the copyright
  notice that appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not
  remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights
  notice contained in any portion of the Licensed Software including but
  not limited to the About Boxes; (iii) Licensee will indemnify and hold
  The Qt Company, its Affiliates, contractors, and its suppliers, harmless
   from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of the use,
  reproduction or distribution of Applications; (iv) Applications must be
  developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software;
  (v) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the
  Licensed Software; (vi) Applications may not pass on functionality which
   in any way makes it possible for others to create software with the
  Licensed Software; however Licensee may use the Licensed Software’s
  scripting and QML (“Qt Quick”) functionality solely in order to enable
  scripting, themes and styles that augment the functionality and
  appearance of the Application(s) without adding primary and substantial
  functionality to the Application(s); (vii) Licensee may create Modified
  Software that breaks the source or binary compatibility with the
  Licensed Software. This includes, but is not limited to, changing the
  application programming interfaces (“API”) by adding, changing or
  deleting any variable, method, or class signature in the Licensed
  Software, the inter-process QCop specification, and/or any inter-process
   protocols, services or standards in the Licensed Software libraries. To
   the extent that Licensee breaks source or binary compatibility with the
   Licensed Software, Licensee acknowledges that The Qt Company’s ability
  to provide Support may be prevented or limited and Licensee’s ability to
   make use of Updates may be restricted; (viii) Applications may not
  compete with the Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use The Qt
  Company’s or any of its suppliers’ names, logos, or trademarks to market
   Applications, except to state that Licensee’s Application(s) was
  developed using the Licensed Software; and (x) each Designated User
  creating the Application(s) needs to have a separate license for the
  Licensed Software.

  NOTE: If Licensee, or another third party, has, at any time,
  developed or distributed all (or any portions of) the Application(s)
  using an open source version of Qt licensed under the terms of the GNU
  Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later (“LGPL”) or the GNU
  General Public License version 2.0 or later (“GPL”), Licensee may
  contact The Qt Company via email to address sales@qt.io to ask for the
  necessary permission to combine such development work with the Licensed
  Software. The Qt Company shall evaluate Licensee´s request, and respond
  to the request with estimated license costs and other applicable terms
  and details relating to the permission for the Licensee, depending on
  the actual situation in question. Copies of the licenses referred to
  above are located at
  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html,
  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html,

  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-3.0.html.


  9. PRE-RELEASE CODE

  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality
  marked or otherwise stated as “Technology Preview”, “Alpha”, “Beta” or
  similar. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide
  experimental support for new platforms or preliminary version of new
  functionality. The pre-release code is not at the level of performance
  and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering. The
   pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly
  and may be substantially modified prior to the first commercial product
  release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make
  pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or
  Updates relating thereto.


  10. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

  The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants with respect to the
  Licensed Software that it has the power and authority to grant the
  rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement. Except as
  set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee “as is”.
  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, The Qt Company on
  behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all warranties and
  conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited to,
  implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
  purpose, title and non-infringement regarding to the Licensed Software.


  11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  If, The Qt Company’s warranty disclaimer notwithstanding, The Qt
  Company is held to be liable to Licensee whether in contract, tort, or
  any other legal theory, based on the Licensed Software, The Qt Company’s
   entire liability to Licensee and Licensee’s exclusive remedy shall be,
  at The Qt Company’s option, either (a) return of the price Licensee paid
   for the Licensed Software, or (b) repair or replacement of the Licensed
   Software, provided Licensee returns all copies of the Licensed Software
   to The Qt Company as originally delivered to Licensee. The Qt Company
  shall not under any circumstances be liable to Licensee based on failure
   of the Licensed Software if the failure resulted from accident, abuse
  or misapplication, nor shall The Qt Company, under any circumstances, be
   liable for special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for
  loss of profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of
   data. Any award of damages from The Qt Company to Licensee shall not
  exceed the total amount Licensee has paid to The Qt Company in
  connection with this Agreement.


  12. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES

  Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use
  the Online Services during the Supported Term, in accordance with The Qt
   Company’s then current policies and procedures, if any. Such policies
  and procedures may be changed from time to time. For clarity, under the
  Limited Subscription License, the Licensee shall not be eligible to
  receive any Support for the Licensed Software.

  As for the Perpetual License, unless Licensee notifies The Qt Company
   in writing no less than thirty (30) days prior to each expiry of
  Supported Term, Supported Term may, at the Qt Company’s option be
  extended by Renewal Term, subject to due payments by Licensee and
  subject to The Qt Company’s terms and conditions applicable at the time
  of extension.

  In the event Licensee selects not to have Supported Term extended,
  The Qt Company shall, following the expiry of Supported Term, no longer
  make the Licensed Software, Support, Updates or Online Services
  available to Licensee.


  13. CONFIDENTIALITY

  Each party acknowledges that during the Start-For-Free-Term and
  Supported Term of this Agreement it shall have access to information
  about the other party’s business, business methods, business plans,
  customers, business relations, technology, and other information,
  including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great
   value to the other party, and the value of which would be significantly
   reduced if disclosed to third parties (“Confidential Information”).
  Accordingly, when a party (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential
  Information from another party (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving
  Party shall, and shall obligate its employees and agents and employees
  and agents of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain the Confidential
  Information in strict confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential
  Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party’s prior
  written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the
  Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its
  rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement.
  Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential
  Information of the other party, which measures shall not be less than
  the measures taken by such party to protect its own confidential and
  proprietary information.

  “Confidential Information” shall not include information that (a) is
  or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of
  the Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession
  prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on
  disclosure or use; (c) is developed by employees of the Receiving Party
  or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access
   to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by
  the written records of the Receiving Party or by persons who have not
  had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as
  proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (d) is lawfully
  disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party
  not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (e) the Receiving Party
  is legally compelled to disclose the information, in which case the
  Receiving Party shall assert the privileged and confidential nature of
  the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to protect
   against and prevent disclosure of any Confidential Information and to
  limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed
  Confidential Information by all legally available means.

  The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue
   during the Supported Term and for a period of five (5) years after
  expiration or termination of this Agreement. To the extent that the
  terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between The Qt Company and
  Licensee conflict with the terms of this Section 13, this Section 13
  shall be controlling over the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.


  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS

  14.1 No Assignment

  Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its
  rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior
  written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably
  withheld. The Qt Company shall be entitled to assign or transfer any of
  its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement on an
  unrestricted basis.

  14.2 Termination

  The Qt Company may terminate the Agreement at any time immediately upon
  written notice by The Qt Company to Licensee if Licensee breaches this
  Agreement.

  Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
  immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party
  becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any
  assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative
  receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of
  its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of
  the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other party.

  Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall cease using the
  Licensed Software and return to The Qt Company all copies of Licensed
  Software that were supplied by The Qt Company. All other copies of
  Licensed Software in the possession or control of Licensee must be
  erased or destroyed. An officer of Licensee must promptly deliver to The
   Qt Company a written confirmation that this has occurred.

  14.3 Surviving Sections

  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably
  should survive a cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall
  also be deemed to survive. Such surviving terms and conditions include,
  but are not limited to the Section 13.

  14.4 Entire Agreement

  This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the parties
  and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions,
  representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the
  subject matters discussed herein, with the exception of the
  non-disclosure agreement executed by the parties in connection with this
   Agreement (“Non-Disclosure Agreement”), if any, shall be subject to
  Section 13. No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless
  contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each
  party. No term or condition contained in Licensee’s purchase order shall
   apply unless expressly accepted by The Qt Company in writing. If any
  provision of the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder
   shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any
  remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose,
  all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
   Agreement shall remain in effect.

  14.5 Payment and Taxes

  If credit has been extended to Licensee by The Qt Company, all payments
  under this Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date The Qt
  Company mails its invoice to Licensee. If The Qt Company has not
  extended credit to Licensee, Licensee shall be required to make payment
  concurrent with the delivery of the Licensed Software by The Qt Company.
   All amounts payable are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added
  tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax. Licensee shall be entitled to
  withhold from payments any applicable withholding taxes and comply with
  all applicable tax and employment legislation. Each party shall pay all
  taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or
  levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties
   as a result of this Agreement and any payments made hereunder
  (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments).
  Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to
   enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including
   original withholding tax certificates.

  As for the Limited Subscription License, the fees under this
  Agreement applicable for the Licensee, as further stated in www.qt.io,
  are subject to Licensee´s annual sales revenue being smaller than one
  hundred thousand (&lt;100,000) USD. In case the Licensee´s annual sales
  revenue would increase up to one hundred thousand (100,000) USD or more,
   (i) the Licensee shall inform The Qt Company without undue delay in
  written form of such increase, and (ii) The Qt Company shall reserve the
   right to change applicable pricing for The Licensee, depending on The
  Qt Company´s then current pricing, as further stated in www.qt.io. The
  Licensee shall have the obligation, upon reasonable prior request by The
   Qt Company, to prove that its annual sales revenue is smaller than one
  hundred thousand (&lt;100,000) USD in order for the Licensee to be
  entitled to continue using the Limited Subscription License.

  14.6 Force Majeure

  Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or
  non-performance of its obligations hereunder other than the obligation
  of paying the license fees in the event and to the extent that such
  delay or non-performance is due to an event of Force Majeure (as defined
   below). If any event of Force Majeure results in a delay or
  non-performance of a party for a period of three (3) months or longer,
  then either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with
  immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of
  payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other
  party. A “Force Majeure” event shall mean an act of God, terrorist
  attack or other catastrophic event of nature that prevents either party
  for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.

  14.7 Notices

  Any notice given by one party to the other shall be deemed properly
  given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving
  party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by
  hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business
   day to the addresses specified below. Each communication and document
  made or delivered by one party to the other party pursuant to this
  Agreement shall be in the English language or accompanied by a
  translation thereof.

  14.8 Export Control

  Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Software may be subject to
  export control restrictions of various countries. Licensee shall fully
  comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements
  as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the importation of
  the Licensed Software and/or Modified Software and/or Applications and
  shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including
  without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or
  consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Licensed
  Software, Modified Software or Applications.

  14.9 Personal Data

   Personal Data relating to the Licensee or its Designated Users, for the
   purposes stated below.

  need-to-know basis for such Personal Data to be able to provide its
  services to The Qt Company, or (2) in order to comply with the law or
  requests of governmental entities. Given the global nature of The Qt
  Company´s business, processing information for such purposes may involve
   a cross-border transfer of Personal Data. In addition, The Qt Company
  may collect individual user´s IP address and browser cookies about the
  use of services or tools relating to Licensed Software, and visits to
  The Qt Company´s web pages.

  In processing and transferring Personal Data The Qt Company shall
  comply with all applicable European or foreign data protection laws as
  effective from time to time.

  14.10 Governing Law and Legal Venue

  award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of
  competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Helsinki,
  Finland and the process shall be conducted in the English language.

  14.11 No Implied License

  There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this
   Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder,
  shall remain with The Qt Company and its licensors. In addition, no

  Introduction
  ============

    This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
    Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
    applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
    under their own explicit license.

    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We  don&#39;t promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)

      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)

      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        Catharon Code. (`credits&#39;)

    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
    Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
    their use.

  licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
  their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
  Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
  submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
  constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
  patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
  shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions: You must give any other recipients

  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that You changed the files; and

  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
  You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
  notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices

  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
  the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
  part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
  the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
  modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
  within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
  addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
  additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
  the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
  modifications and may provide additional or different license
  terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
  Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
  provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
  otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.


  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
  otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
  in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
  conditions of this License, without any additional terms or

  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
  FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for

  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
  arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
  to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
  Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
  redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
  choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
  warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
  consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
  obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
  responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
  harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
  against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
  warranty or additional liability.

  shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
  link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
  Derivative Works thereof.

  &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

  perpetual,   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
  irrevocable   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative
  Works of,   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
  distribute the   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
  Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
  made,   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
  the Work,   where such license applies only to those patent claims
  licensable   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
  their   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
  Contribution(s)   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
  submitted. If You   institute patent litigation against any entity
  (including a   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Work   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
  constitutes direct   or contributory patent infringement, then any
  patent licenses   granted to You under this License for that Work
  shall terminate   as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and may provide additional or different license terms and
    conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
    otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
  otherwise,   any Contribution intentionally submitted for
  inclusion in the Work   by You to the Licensor shall be under the
  terms and conditions of   this License, without any additional
  terms or conditions.   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
  shall supersede or modify   the terms of any separate license
  agreement you may have executed   with Licensor regarding such
  Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
  trade   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
  Licensor,   except as required for reasonable and customary use in
  describing the   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
  the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
  conditions   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
  determining the   appropriateness of using or redistributing the
  Work and assume any   risks associated with Your exercise of
  permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
  special,   incidental, or consequential damages of any character
  arising as a   result of this License or out of the use or
  inability to use the   Work (including but not limited to damages
  for loss of goodwill,   work stoppage, computer failure or
  malfunction, or any and all   other commercial damages or losses),
  even if such Contributor   has been advised of the possibility of
  such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
  redistributing   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
  choose to offer,   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
  warranty, indemnity,   or other liability obligations and/or
  rights consistent with this   License. However, in accepting such
  obligations, You may act only   on Your own behalf and on Your
  sole responsibility, not on behalf   of any other Contributor, and
  only if You agree to indemnify,   defend, and hold each
  Contributor harmless for any liability   incurred by, or claims
  asserted against, such Contributor by reason   of your accepting
  any such warranty or additional liability.

    IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements Microsoft's

    and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the
    Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility
    interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in
    MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich
    document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web
    browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for
    rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large
    mainstream applications.

  </em>
  -- quoted from
  <code>qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README</code>
  .
</p>
<p>
  The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
  These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
  License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
  their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
  licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your
  needs.
</p>
<p>
  To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed under
  the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License, Version
  2.0
</p>
<p>
  However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL
  license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
  of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology
  both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot
  use the GPL.
</p>
<p>
  You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
  question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
  modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
  ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the
  license used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities
  or added features.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
  package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for
  more information.

    See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
    Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
    please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

              8.1.1 any breach of Licensee&#39;s obligations in ARTICLE 4; or
              8.1.2 any breach of the confidentiality obligations under ARTICLE 9 by Licensee, its Affiliates, employees, or contractors; or

  ARTICLE 9
  CONFIDENTIALITY
        9.1 Non-use and Non-disclosure.  Each Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose except for the purposes set forth in this Agreement.  Each Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party, except that, subject to Section 9.2 below, a receiving Party may disclose the other Party&#39;s Confidential Information (except Source Code unless otherwise specified in writing) to those employees of the receiving Party who are required to have the information for the purposes set forth in this Agreement, and relevant consultants, provided that the receiving Party first obtains a signed confidentiality agreement with terms similar to this Agreement from the consultants, such that consultants are under a confidentiality obligation to the receiving Party.  If a receiving Party is required by law to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Agreement, the receiving Party will provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving Party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that the receiving Party provides such reasonable assistance as the disclosing Party may request in obtaining such order or other relief.
        9.2 Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Each Party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other Party.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials).  Prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, each Party shall ensure that such employees who have access to the other Party&#39;s Confidential Information have signed a non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions of this Agreement or are otherwise legally obligated not to disclose such Confidential Information.  Each Party shall reproduce the other Party&#39;s proprietary rights notices on any photo or electronic copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  A Party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the Party disclosing such Confidential Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving Party becomes aware.
        9.3 Source Code.  For purposes of clarity, any Source Code may not be disclosed by a receiving Party to any third party, including consultants under non-disclosure agreements, without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party.
        9.4 Limitation on Copying.  Other than Awesomium Technologies&#39;s rights in the Improvements, the disclosing Party retains and owns all copyrights, rights in derivative works in the Confidential Information and the receiving Party hereby agrees not to copy the Confidential Information, in whole or in part, except as is necessary to perform its tasks under this Agreement.
        9.5 Return of Materials.  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either Party to the other Party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing Party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing Party upon the disclosing Party&#39;s written request.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one (1) copy of any written or photographic Confidential Information provided by the other Party may be retained by the receiving Party for archival purposes only.
        9.6 Duration.  The confidentiality obligations of each receiving Party under this Agreement shall survive until such time as all Confidential Information of the other Party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving Party.  The obligations to hold information in confidence as required by ARTICLE 9 also shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
        9.7 Duty to Notify of Confidentiality Breach.  Either Party shall immediately provide written notice to the other Party of any breach of this ARTICLE 9, specifying the specific nature of the breach.  The breaching Party shall then have thirty (30) days to reasonably cure the breach.  Should such breach not be reasonably cured within sixty (60) days from receipt of such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement.
        9.8 Availability of Equitable Relief.  Each Party understands and agrees that its breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the other Party and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy for such breach or threatened breach, and both parties hereby agree that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.  The Parties&#39; rights under this Agreement are cumulative, and a Party&#39;s exercise of one right shall not waive the Party&#39;s right to assert any other legal remedy.
  ARTICLE 10

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
  While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
