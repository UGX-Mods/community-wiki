  This guide will explain in detail how to report a Bug or give Feedback (
  criticism, suggestion, ... )
</p>
<p>
  You should take a look at the
  <span class="confluence-link">
    <a href="/UGXL/Information/Crash-Reporter.html">Crash Reporter</a>
  </span>
  if you want to know how to report an application crash (or what exactly
  happens and what user data is gathered)
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="HowtoreportaBugorFeedback-HowtoopentheCommunityReportWindow">
  How to open the Community Report Window
</h3>
<p>This can be achieved by two ways.</p>
<p>
  First way would be the key combination:
  <strong>ALT + R</strong>
  to open the report issue / feedback window.
</p>
<p>
  Or simply click on the &quot;Report Issue / Feedback&quot; within the
  application (located in the upper button row of the UGX Launcher window)
</p>

  Once you sent a report, you should get a confirm dialog which gives you an
  issue key and a link to the issue back.
</p>
<p>
  Visit it frequently ( you should get an e-Mail once the ticket gets updated )
  and ( as soon as registration is possible! | currently disabled! ) respond to
  any questions regards your issue.

  easier.

<p> </p>
<p>
  Explaining JIRA in detail would be too much and is for you as a normal forum
  user not needed.
