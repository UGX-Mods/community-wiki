<p>The UGX Launcher will be shipped with a crash reporter (called CrashRpt)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Once the application crashes, it will generate an Error Report which will be
  sent to the UGX Masterserver.
</p>
<p>
  In this document you will understand what the crash reporter does, what data
  it gathers and sents to the UGX Masterserver.

  Why is the crash reporter needed?
</h2>
<p>
  The crash reporter is an important part for the alpha / beta of the UGX
  Launcher.
</p>
<p>
  The UGX Launcher is a large software and there might be that case where it
  crashes.
</p>
<p>
  Without the crash reporter, it would be really hard to reproduce this issue (
  nearly almost impossible ! )
</p>
<p>
  Also, usually normal users don't report the crash which leads to frustration
  for the user and no notifcation to the developer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  The crash reporer will take care of everything. Once the application crashes
  it gathers the important files, containing information why exactly the
  application crashed.
</p>

<p>
  The following information does the crash reporter sent to the UGX
  Masterserver:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    crashdump.dmp Needed to reproduce why and where the application crashed)
  </li>
  <li>
    crashrpt.xml (Needed to identify the issue in detail)
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>CrashGUID (Unique ID to identify the crash)</li>
      <li>AppName &amp; AppVersion (self explaining)</li>
      <li>Operating System name and architecture</li>

  Whats next after sending the crash report
</h2>
<p>
  Once the crash report was uploaded to our server, it will be reproduced by our
  automation build server.
</p>
<p>
  The gathered build / crash report will then tell us exactly what happened and
  it will create a new bug ticket.
</p>
<p>
  And hopefully, thanks to your report, it can be resolved very quickly to get
  rid of this crash.

  Thanks to everyone whoparticipates and uploads / reports crashes. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
