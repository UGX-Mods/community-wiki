<h2 id="T4M-WhatisT4M?">What is T4M?</h2>
<p>
  T4M is a dll which hooks into CoDWaW's process. The dll is loaded through
  DirectX (d3d9.dll) and adds/extends features to the game which Treyarch never
  gave us.

  <li>
    An extra fastfile named &quot;mod_ex&quot; will be loaded if a mod is loaded
    and exists in that mod, it has priority over all others (so it overrides
    mod). (r42)

<h2 id="T4M-WhydoIneedT4M?">Why do I need T4M?</h2>
<p>
  Some map makers in the community have developed maps which exceed the limits
  of the standard version of CoDWaW.
  <br />
  They contain more textures/weapons/features than the game was originally
  designed to allow.
  <br />
  These maps
  <strong>will not run without T4M installed</strong>
  <strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to play a map which requires T4M, you will need to let the UGX
  Launcher install it for you.
  <br />
  If you don't wish to install T4M, simply ignore maps which require it (using
  the Filters option in UGXL for example).
</p>
<h2 id="T4M-SupportedGameVersions">Supported Game Versions</h2>
<p>
  Only the official Steam version of the CoDWaW exe or the &quot;LanFixed&quot;
  pirate exe will work with T4M.
  <br />
  The standard DVD version of the CoDWaW exe is
  <strong>not compatible</strong>
  with T4M due to increased difficulty from protections by Treyarch.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not own the Steam version of CoDWaW, we suggest buying it from Steam
  to gain T4M compatibility.
</p>
<p>
  We do not condone finding the pirated LanFixed.exe to make DVD versions of the
  game compatible.

<h3 id="T4M-Q:Isitsecure?">Q: Is it secure?</h3>
<p>A: Yes! We test each version of T4M and run a virus test against it.</p>
<h3 id="T4M-Q:Ican&#39;tplayT4MmapseventhoughIhavealegalDVDversionofCoDWaW!">
  Q: I can't play T4M maps even though I have a legal DVD version of CoDWaW!
</h3>
<p>
  A: Sorry, the DVD version of CoD WaW is not compatible with T4M. See
  &quot;Supported Game Versions&quot; above for more info.

  A: This is a common issue with T4M and Windows 10-users. If you get this with
  T4M and/or Windows 10, there are few ways to fix this issue:
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/h4Ug4Mb.jpg" target="_blank">1</a>
      st: Sometimes just restarting mod can fix this, but it's unlikely to
      happen. Try this, if you are playing solo as it's easy and quick to test.
    </span>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
      2nd: Open Options/Texture Settings, turn Texture Quality from Automatic to
      Manual (if it's set as Automatic) and then turn all settings from your
      settings to one step lower, for example turn Extra to High. Do this on all
      three settings that are shown (Texture Resolution, Normal Map Resolution
      and Specular Map Resolution) Then launch the map ( do not do this in-game
      as it can crash the whole game)
    </span>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 102)">
      3rd: Open Options/Graphics and turn off Specular Map and/or Shadows.
