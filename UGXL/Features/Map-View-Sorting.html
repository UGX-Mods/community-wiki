  Thanks to 
  <a class="unresolved" href="#">UGXPLAY</a>
  we are able to store more information about each map/mod in the UGX Launcher,
  which gives you lots of sorting options!
</p>
<p>
  It's possible to sort maps based on release date, install count, size and more
  to quickly find the maps you are looking for.
