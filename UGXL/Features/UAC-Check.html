<p>
  The Windows
  <strong>U</strong>
  ser
  <strong>A</strong>
  ccount
  <strong>C</strong>
  ontrol (UAC) has caused a lot of trouble for the users of
  <a href="/UGXL/Information/UGX-MapManager-Legacy.html">UGX Map Manager</a>
  , blocking it from installing files into your CoDWaW mods folder.
</p>
<p>
  The UGX Launcher requires Admin Rights now per default and will notify the
  user if the UAC settings need to be changed, which will help users solve these
  common permissions issues themselves.
