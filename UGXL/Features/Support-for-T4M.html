<p>
  UGX Launcher has full support for installing and using
  <a href="/UGXL/Information/T4M.html">T4M</a>
  .
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  UGX Launcher will check if your installed version of CoDWaW supports T4M and
  check if T4M is installed already and up-2-date.
</p>
<p>
  The user will be asked to automatically install T4M once they try to download
  a map which requires it.
