<p>
  The old
  <a href="/UGXL/Information/UGX-MapManager-Legacy.html">UGX Map Manager</a>
  had issues with Anti-Virus and Firewall applications blocking its access to
  our download server.
</p>
<p>
  With the
  <a href="/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a>
  we are trying our best to solve this problem by detecting your installed
  programs and adding rule exceptions automatically. If we can't add an
  automatic rule or don't recognize your anti-virus/firewall, we will do our
  best to link you to detailed instructions on how to fix it yourself or report
  the issue to us.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  (This is currently only enabled in the
  <a href="/UGXLIN">UGXL Installer</a>
  so that download issues are discovered and potentially solved before the user
  tries to use the UGX Launcher)
