                    <p>The old <a href="10420785.html">UGX Map Manager</a> had issues with Anti-Virus and Firewall applications blocking its access to our download server.</p><p>With the <a href="https://confluence.ugx-mods.com/display/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a> we are trying our best to solve this problem by detecting your installed programs and adding rule exceptions automatically. If we can't add an automatic rule or don't recognize your anti-virus/firewall, we will do our best to link you to detailed instructions on how to fix it yourself or report the issue to us.</p><p>Â </p><p>(This is currently only enabled in the <a href="https://confluence.ugx-mods.com/display/UGXLIN/UGXL+Installer">UGXL Installer</a> so that download issues are discovered and potentially solved before the user tries to use the UGX Launcher)</p>
