  The UGX Launcher supports a custom mods folder for Call of Duty: World at War.
</p>
<p>
  That means that you can save space on your Windows (default, C:\) drive
  because you don't have to use the AppData folder forced by CoDWaW for mod
  installation.

<p>
  To change your mods folder, open the
  <a href="Settings_4391026.html">Settings</a>
  and go on CoD WaW.
</p>
<p>
  There you can select a custom mods folder. UGX Launcher will open CoDWaW with
  special launch parameters to tell it the location of your custom mods folder.
  If you open CoDWaW separately from UGX Launcher it will not find your custom
  mods folder!

    <p>
      After you change your mods folder, you need to
      <strong>restart</strong>
      the UGX Launcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will take a bit until it's closed, because it will move any existing
      mods to the new directory!
