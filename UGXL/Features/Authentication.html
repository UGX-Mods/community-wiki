<p>We decided this for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent download spam.</li>
  <li>
    More personalized features for the user, both now and in the future with
    more additions.
  </li>
  <li>Better control &amp; moderating from our end.</li>
  <li>
    Access control based on the user for testing and also restriction purposes.
    <br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The authentication over the internet will be transmitted over an encrypted
  connection.
