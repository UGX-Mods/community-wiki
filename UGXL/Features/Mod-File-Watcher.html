<p>
  Any changes to the files within your specified CoDWaW mod folder will be
  tracked by UGX Launcher in real time.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as you modify a file (edit, rename, add, remove, move) or if you add /
  remove a mod folder, the UGX Launcher will verify the changed items and alert
  you if there are any problems.
