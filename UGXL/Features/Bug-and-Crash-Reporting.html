<p>The UGX Launcher has a built in Issue and Feedback reporting tool.</p>
<p>
  We want to give our users a fast and easy way to submit issues and Feedback so
  we can improve our applications.

  </span>
</p>
<p>(Report Feedback or Bug / Issue directly through the application)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  If you encounter a crash, it is most likely that CrashRpt, a Crash Handling
  Softwate, will catch it.
</p>
<p>
  We would appreciate it if users will sent these reports so we can gather more
  information about the cause and fix it in an upcoming version! ❤️
