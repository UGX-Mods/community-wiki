  One of the first things you will notice is the new <a href="11796556.html"
    >Custom User Interface</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  And the best thing is: If you don't like it you can
  <a href="How-to-create-a-custom-Theme_4391011.html">Create a custom theme</a>
  and submit it to the Community.
  <img
    class="emoticon emoticon-heart"
    src="images/icons/emoticons/heart.svg"
    data-emoticon-name="heart"
    alt="(heart)"
    data-emoji-short-name=":heart:"
  />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  This is a long process to convert and design all elements into custom ones.
</p>
<p>
  Users will notice in the first few versions some issues like slow repainting,
  flickering or other glitches.
</p>
<p>
  Over the time this will be improved and optimized for the best visual
  experience.
