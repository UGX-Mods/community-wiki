  The UGX Launcher tells me there are disallowed files

<p>
  The UGX Launcher is verifying each map folder if it's up-2-date and if there
  are any files which shouldn't be there.

      The files are disallowed because they are in the map folder. If you move
      them out, everything will be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UGX Launcher will only offer to delete them. So if you want to move
      them out, click
      <strong>NO</strong>
      or 
      <strong>Skip</strong>
      and 
      <u>move them out of the map folder</u>

<h1 id="Disallowedfiles(Legacy)-Whyarethosefilesorfilemodificationdisallowed?">
  Why are those files or file modification disallowed?
</h1>
<p>
  Usually, a modification means that a player tried to exploit a script to make
  the game easier. - We
  <strong>try</strong>
  to prevent this.
</p>
<p>
  Additional *.iwd and *.ff could be loaded by the game automatically, which
  could invoke new scripts or mess with the map / mod. - We
  <strong>try</strong>
  to prevent this.

  What are the consequences if I don't delete them?

<p>
  The map will be marked as
  <strong>Corrupt</strong>
  and but you still can play the map.
