    <p>The UGX Mods Team recently moved to JIRA.</p>
    <p>
      We are still in the beginning pase, so please be patient and understanding
      that we are a busy tiny developer team
    </p>
    <p>
      and can't respond to all issues asap and that we try to be very open with
      what we do.

<p>
  JIRA is a project management software, which makes our work as a developer
  easier.
</p>
<p>
  We want that
  <strong>YOU</strong>
  take part in our journey and help us out. As a reward, we can respond faster
  to your issue and
</p>
<p>hopefully also implement a proper solution for you fast enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  Explaining JIRA in detail would be too much and is for you as a normal forum
  user not needed.
</p>
<p>
  So this guide is a more like a &quot;
  <strong>How to get fast started with JIRA and what do I need to know</strong>
  &quot;

  the
