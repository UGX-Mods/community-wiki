<h2 id="Howtoaddamap/modtotheUGXLauncher/UGXPlay-Namingyourmod">
  Naming your mod
</h2>
<p>
  We recommend to name your mod only with 0-9 A-Z a-z - _ to ensure it works for
  every system.
</p>
<p>
  We highly recommend to exclude any version number from your mod! (old maps
  have them included because of legacy reasons)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Don't worry</strong>
  the version information can be viewed much butter within the
  <a href="/UGXL">UGX Launcher</a>
  or on UGX Play !
</p>
<h2 id="Howtoaddamap/modtotheUGXLauncher/UGXPlay-Whatisversionandrevision">
  What is version and revision
</h2>
<p>
  The revision is an increment able number, which starts at one and with every
  version / update it will be incremented by one.
</p>
<p>The version is the text which will be displayed instead of the revision.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
  <table class="confluenceTable">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Revision</th>
        <th>Version</th>
        <th>Filename (since v0.8)</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>v1.0</td>
        <td>&lt;modname&gt;.r1.7z</td>
        <td>1st version of map</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>v1.2</td>
        <td>&lt;modname&gt;.r2.7z</td>
        <td>2nd version of the UGC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>v1.2.3</td>
        <td>&lt;modname&gt;.r3.7z</td>
