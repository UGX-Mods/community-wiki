  The UGX Scripting Reference (
  <a href="https://ugx-mods.com/script" target="_blank">
    www.ugx-mods.com/script
  </a>
  ) is a website which lists all available Call of Duty: World at War Script
  Functions.
</p>
<p>
  Addtionally, the site offers many neat useability features, like a recent-
  &amp; favorite list, nice syntax and script examples.
</p>
<p>
  UGX also added ultiity functions to the list, to offer newcomers hints to
  already solved scripting issues.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  In attempt to have the most up-2-date Scripting Reference in the web - soon -
  UGX will allow community members to add / edit scripting functions.
