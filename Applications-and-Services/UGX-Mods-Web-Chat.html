    <p>
      Apprently the UGX-Mods Chat has been discontinued, because other UGX-Mods
      projects are more important.

  The UGX-Mods Chat was (as many of you know) very old and was needed during a
  time where users wanted to connect together and chat easily.
</p>
<p>
  With Discord - we found a good solution which works better and doesn't require
  our software maintaining.
</p>
<p>
  It also supports cross-platform support and other great features, which we
  simply can't deliver as a one-man development team.

<p>
  The development of the chat started around September 2012 and in October 2012
  the chat was released
</p>
<p>In Novemer 2012, the chat was a stable alpha version</p>
<p>
  Since then, no major updates were made because other projects were more
  important.
</p>
<p>
  The development of the UGX Launcher was more important and the plan was to
  integrate the chat into it
</p>
<p>
  Treminaor introduced a tool (Ban Hammer) to moderators, to moderate the chat
  more efficiently
</p>
<p>
  October 2013, the plan was to release a new Chat v2, which was integrated into
  an Usermenu (top and bottom bar) on every page.
</p>
<p>Sadly, the development was stopped again because of other UGX projects.</p>
<p>
  Maybe in the future, we can bring back a light chat which is fully integrated
  into the UGX-Mods Website and UGX Launcher.
