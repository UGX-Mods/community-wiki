  The UGX-Mods Forum supports a b8 spam filter since

<h2 id="b8spamfiltering-QuickGuide">Quick Guide</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every message is classified as unlearned.</li>
  <li>
    A message should be learned as SPAM or HARMLESS depending on what type it
    is.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Only content which is identified as SPAM should be learned as such, this
        includes for example
        <ul>
          <li>
            Link to disallowed content (NSFW content, products, suspicious
            content, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Repeatedly the same content by different accounts</li>
          <li>Whatever you think is SPAM</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Content which doesn't follow our rules, but is written by an individual
        and not a SPAM Bot is therefore no spam and is harmless, but shouldn't
        be allowed (hide or remove it)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Messages can be classified. This returns a score, based on the previous
    learned words.
  </li>
  <li>
    So the more content has been learned, the more likely and accurate is the
    score.
  </li>
  <li>The score goes from 0.0 (no spam) to 1.0 (spam)</li>
  <li>At the moment we consider SPAM which is &gt;= 0.7</li>

    for b8 overview
  </li>
  <li>
    Be sure to learn from time to time some messages. (not all messages of the
    forum need to be learned, but different written types of SPAM and HARMLESS
    content is important)
  </li>
  <li>Messages can be reclassified (over time, so their score can change)</li>
  <li>
    Messages can also be unlearned again, previously classified content won't
    update though!
