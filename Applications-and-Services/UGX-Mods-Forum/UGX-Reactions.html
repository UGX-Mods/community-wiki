    limit of reactions
    <ul>
      <li>
        Please note that newly created accounts have a drastically reduced limit
        which will be lifted like the requirement of moderation approval of
        forum messages once the user reached the next post based forum group
        (see
        <a href="/Applications-and-Services/UGX-Mods-Forum/Forum-groups.html">
          Forum groups
        </a>
        for more information)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The user has the permission to view the topic / board</li>
  <li>The message is approved, not frozen or hidden</li>
  <li>
    The user was not banned from adding reaction (can be issued by an admin or
    moderator if the user abuses the reaction feature)
  </li>
</ul>

  Criterias to remove reactions
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Moderators can freeze reactions. If this happens the user won't be able to
    remove reactions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <sup>
    [1] A reaction is considered as started if you are the first one who adds
    this reaction to the entity.
    <br />
        The starter is always the first person who has added the reaction and
    the limit was implemented to avoid that one users can block further
    reactions.
