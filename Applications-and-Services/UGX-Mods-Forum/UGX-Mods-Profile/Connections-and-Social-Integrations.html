  Also users can register directly with such an account with some pre filled
  fields. (see below for more information)
</p>

  <strong>Note:</strong>
  the connections are READ-ONLY and therefore won't do anything on behalf of you
  to your external account.

  If UGX-Mods is ever going to change the permission (in order to interact with

  I unlinked my external account and I can't login anymore

<p>
  In this case you need to login with your email and password. If you never
  received a password yet, requst one here:
  <a href="https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?action=reminder">
    Request new password
  </a>

<h3
  id="ConnectionsSocialIntegrations-MyDiscordrolesarenotsyncedorIstillhavenoaccesstomoreDiscordrooms">
  My Discord roles are not synced or I still have no access to more Discord
  rooms
</h3>
<p>
  Most likely the request couldn't be executed and you need to relink your
  account and try it again.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlink your account</li>
  <li>
    Link your account (ensure you use the correct Discord account in case you
    have multiple!)
  </li>
  <li>Check again</li>
</ul>
<h3
  id="ConnectionsSocialIntegrations-WhyshouldIlinkoneoremoreaccountswithmyUGX-Modsaccount?">
  Why should I link one ore more accounts with my UGX-Mods account?
</h3>
<p>There are different reasons to link your external accounts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Login with your external provider (like Twitter or Google) without a
    password or email address or username. One click is enough.
  </li>
  <li>Faster registration with pre filled fields.</li>
  <li>
    Certain providers allow enhancements. For example linking Discord will grant
    you all proper Discord Roles in compliance with your UGX-Mods Forum groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the future: more account trustworthy. A healthy account with active
    external connections will grant you more trustworthy
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ConnectionsSocialIntegrations-Aretheresecurityconcerns?">
  Are there security concerns?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Only minimal ones:
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        If an attacker hijacks your external account, he might get also access
        to your UGX-Mods account if he successfully authenticates from UGX-Mods
        with your external provider. But this is very minimal and is strongly
        affected by your general security and how secret your credentials are.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    UGX-Mods does only save your unique identifier at the moment. We use this to
    identify your once you login / register on our site.
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is nothing to worry about this, we can't do anything else with
        this other than to know that the given account has the identifier XYZ.
        (it is like your user id on our UGX-Mods Forum)
